# Cassandra's toolbox

## Installation

I recommend using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install this project:

```
$ pipx install 'git+https://git.sapphicco.de/SapphicCode/toolbox.git'

  installed package sapphiccode-toolbox 0.0.0.post1.dev0+de0bfa3, installed using Python 3.11.4
  These apps are now globally available

done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

If you depend on this project I also recommend pinning a specific revision, as this project is WIP and things are very much subject to change.

Additionally, the `image` group of commands optionally require [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)/[GraphicsMagick](https://www.graphicsmagick.org/).
