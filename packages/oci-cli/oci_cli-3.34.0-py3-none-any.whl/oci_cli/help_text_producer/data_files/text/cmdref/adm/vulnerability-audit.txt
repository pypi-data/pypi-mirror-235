*******************


Description
===========

A Vulnerability Audit associates the Application Dependencies of a
project with their associated Vulnerabilities. Each Vulnerability is
associated with a score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System V2 or
V3). A vulnerable Application Dependency can be ignored based on the
configuration of the Vulnerability Audit. maxObservedCvssV2Score,
maxObservedCvssV3Score and vulnerableArtifactsCount do not take into
account non-vulnerable Application Dependency.
