name: Build and Publish Python Package

on: push

# Here there are five stages to publish on PyPI that must be completed in order:
#
# 1) Build wheel and sdist, check it is valid using twine
# 2) Try installing from the wheel and check for dependency issues
# 3) Publish the package to TestPyPI
# 4) Try installing the package to a new environment from TestPyPI
# 5) Publish the package to PyPI
#
# The first two jobs are run even when we aren't publishing to ensure that the
# build system hasn't been broken in the course of development.
