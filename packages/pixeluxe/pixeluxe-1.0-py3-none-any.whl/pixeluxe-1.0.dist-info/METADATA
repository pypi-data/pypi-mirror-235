# Pixeluxe 1.0

Library to abstract numpy vectorized array operations for pygame surfaces to mimic shader code

NOTE: This won't work like shaders. There is no functions that will run for every pixel, instead there is an interface to use numpy vectorized operations specifically for surfaces with the help of x & y UV arrays.<br>
Also, the speed is limited to numpy speed which while it's a lot, it's not as fast as GPUs so don't run too many shaders at once

## Installation

Install the module from PyPI or downloading the source code here
```
pip install pixeluxe
```

## Usage

NOTE: Get information about all functions, classes and properties with the help of your IDE or checking the source (it's not long)

You can find the same code on tests/readme_test.py

```py
# You'll most likely need this
import pygame, sys
###import pixeluxe
from src.pixeluxe import pixeluxe
import numpy as np
import math as m

# pygame simple setup
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1200,800)) 
clock = pygame.Clock()

# First, define your shader functions

# This is meant to run once or few times, to initialize the pixels values. Custom setup uniforms are allowed
def shader_hello_world_setup(pixels: pixeluxe.PixelsType):
    # Use the pixels property to make a common shader 'Hello World'. Use the PixelsType's docstring to know more about those properties
    # This will be overridden by shader_hello_world_loop, this is just an example
    pixels.r_g_b = [pixels.x, pixels.y, 255]


# Here are 2 functions that should be called every frame, one of them needs a 'time' uniform. 
def shader_noise_loop(pixels: pixeluxe.PixelsType):
    pixels.rgb = pixeluxe.correct_type(np.random.rand(pixels.w,pixels.h)*255)

def shader_hello_world_loop(pixels: pixeluxe.PixelsType, time):
    sin = m.sin(time/500)
    if sin > 0:
        pixels.r_g_b = [pixels.x, pixels.y, (sin+1)/2*255]
    else:
        pixels.r_g_b = [pixels.x, (sin+1)/2*255, pixels.y/2]


# Use those functions to make 2 shaders:
hello_world_shader = pixeluxe.PShader(shader_hello_world_setup, shader_hello_world_loop)
noise_shader = pixeluxe.PShader(None, shader_noise_loop)

# Now let's create 2 surfaces that will use those shaders. Only one dimention is needed as the shaders only work for quads. Use the scaling functions for rectangles
hello_world_surf = pixeluxe.PSurface(400, hello_world_shader)
noise_surf = pixeluxe.PSurface(400, noise_shader)

# Setup should be called after the surface is created
hello_world_surf.shader_setup()

while True:
    [(pygame.quit(), sys.exit()) for e in pygame.event.get() if e.type == pygame.QUIT]
    
    screen.fill("black")
    
    # Call the shader loops on this surface to apply them, passing the correct uniforms
    hello_world_surf.shader_loop(pygame.time.get_ticks())
    noise_surf.shader_loop()
    
    # Tell the PSurface to blit the array onto the output surface. use apply_sized and apply_scaled to change the output surface size
    # We are also making rects for blitting
    hello_world_surf.apply_to_surface()
    rect = hello_world_surf.output_surface.get_rect(midright=(600,400))
    noise_surf.apply_to_surface()
    rect2 = noise_surf.output_surface.get_rect(midleft=(600,400))
    
    # Blit the surface output_surface onto the screen and watch the result!
    screen.blit(hello_world_surf.output_surface, rect)
    screen.blit(noise_surf.output_surface, rect2)
    
    clock.tick(0)
    pygame.display.flip()
    # Let's check our performance
    pygame.display.set_caption(f"{clock.get_fps():.0f}")
