# Pixeluxe 1.0

Library to abstract numpy vectorized array operations for pygame surfaces to mimic shader code

NOTE: This won't work like shaders. There is no functions that will run for every pixel, instead there is an interface to use numpy vectorized operations specifically for surfaces with the help of x & y UV arrays.<br>
Also, the speed is limited to numpy speed which while it's a lot, it's not as fast as GPUs so don't run too many shaders at once

## Installation

Install the module from PyPI or downloading the source code here
```
pip install pixeluxe
```

## Usage

NOTE: Get information about all functions, classes and properties with the help of your IDE or checking the source (it's not long)

You can find the same code on tests/readme_test.py
