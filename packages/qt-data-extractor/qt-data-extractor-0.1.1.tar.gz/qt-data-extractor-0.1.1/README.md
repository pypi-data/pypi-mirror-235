Industrial Data Extractor is an open-source Windows application to extract process data from industrial systems
and historians.

It supports browsing and selecting tags on the target system and extract periods of data into zipped CSVs.

## Getting Started

* Using left panel filter editor to browse for tags or import an Excel sheet with a list of tags.
* Select tags you would like to extract on left panel and add then to the right panel with `Add to Selected Tags` button.
* Select a period to be extracted and sample rate (use `Raw Data` option to extract the original sample rate that is stored within the historian).
* Select `Save Directory` in which your archive will be populated.
* Click `Extract` and confirm your selection.
* Wait until extraction is finished.
