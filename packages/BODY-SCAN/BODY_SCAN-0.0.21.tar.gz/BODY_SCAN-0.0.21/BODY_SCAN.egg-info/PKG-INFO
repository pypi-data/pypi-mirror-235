                    ]

                    "EXCEPTION TRACE": [
                        "Traceback (most recent call last):",
                        "  File \"/REPTILIAN_CLIMATES/MODULES/BODY_SCAN/src/SCAN_PROC/KEG/SCAN.py\", line 69, in SCAN",
                        "    CHECKS [ CHECK ] ()",
                        "  File \"<string>\", line 24, in CHECK_3",
                        "Exception: NOT 100%"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "PATH": "PATH_2_HEALTH.py",
            "EMPTY": true
        }
    ],
    "STATS": {
        "EMPTY": 1,
        "CHECKS": {
            "PASSES": 2,
            "ALARMS": 1
        }
    }
}
```

## HOW TO WRITE CHECKS:

The "CHECKS" dictionary is retrieved with the python "exec"
and then each "CHECK" in "CHECKS" is run.

These checks correspond to the example output shown above.
```
PATH_1_HEALTH.py
```
```
def CHECK_1 ():
	print ("CHECK 1")
	
def CHECK_2 ():
	print ("CHECK 2")
	
def CHECK_3 ():
	raise Exception ("NOT 100%")

CHECKS = {
	"CHECK 1": CHECK_1,
	"CHECK 2": CHECK_2,
	"CHECK 3": CHECK_3
}
```
```
PATH_2_HEALTH.py
```
```
#
#	There isn't a "CHECKS" dictionary present, 
#	so the scanner reports:
#
#		"EMPTY": true
#	
```

## HOW TO START THE BODY SCANNER

```python3
import BODY_SCAN

import pathlib
THIS_FOLDER = pathlib.Path (__file__).parent.resolve ()

from os.path import dirname, join, normpath
SEARCH = normpath (join (THIS_FOLDER, "MODULE"))


SCAN = BODY_SCAN.START (
	#
	#	REQUIRED
	#		This is all the files that are sent to the scanner.
	#
	GLOB = SEARCH + '/**/*HEALTH.py',
	
	#
	#	This runs all the checks in a thread pool,
	#	so maybe at the same time, more or less.
	#
	SIMULTANEOUS = True,
	
	#
	# 	OPTIONAL
	#		These are the folders that are added to "sys.path"
	#
	MODULE_PATHS = [
		normpath (join (SEARCH, "MODULES"))
	],
	
	#
	#	OPTIONAL
	#		This is the folder path to remove from the paths in the output.
	#
	RELATIVE_PATH = SEARCH
)
```

### NOTES
```
Currently all the checks aren't run in parallel,
but sequential order of paths found in glob is not guaranteed.
```
```
Each check suite found by the glob is started by 
a process with a flask API, that is opened on the first available port found.
```
