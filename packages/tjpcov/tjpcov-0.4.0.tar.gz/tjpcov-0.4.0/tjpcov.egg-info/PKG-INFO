# TJPCov

TJPCov is a general covariance calculator interface to be used within LSST DESC.

## Installation

### Non-developer Installation
To use TJPCov, we recommend installing with pip:

 - `python -m pip install .` will install tjpcov and the minimal dependencies.
 - `python -m pip install .\[doc\]` will install tjpcov, the minimal
     dependencies and the dependencies needed to build the documentation.
 - `python -m pip install .\[nmt\]` will install tjpcov, the minimal
     dependencies and the dependencies needed to use NaMaster.
 - `python -m pip install .\[mpi4py\]` will install, the minimal
     dependencies and the mpi4py library to use MPI parallelization.
 - `python -m pip install .\[full\]` will install tjpcov and all dependencies

Note that due to a bug in the NaMaster installation, one needs to make sure numpy is installed before trying to install NaMaster. If you are doing a fresh install, run `python -m pip install .` first, and then `python -m pip install .\[nmt\]`

### Developer Installation

If you want to contribute to TJPCov, run the following steps to set up your development environment.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create the conda environment with `conda env create --file environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment with `conda activate tjpcov`
4. Run `pip install -e .`
5. Run `pytest -vv tests/`


## Planning & development

Ask @felipeaoli or @mattkwiecien for access to the repository and join the #desc-mcp-cov channel on the LSST DESC slack to contribute.

We have adopted the following style convention (which are enforced in each PR):
 - [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
 - [Black code style](https://github.com/psf/black) (with 79 characters line-width)
 - PEP8 except for E203 (for better compatibility with black)

For a general idea of TJPCov's scientific scope, see also the [terms of reference](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/TJPCov/blob/master/doc/Terms_of_Reference.md).

## Contributing

We use `black` and `flake8` configuration files so that code follows a unified coding style and remains PEP8 compliant.

This means before submitting your PR you must run the following in the root directory:
```
black .
flake8 .
```
Furthermore, we are following GitHub's recommendation of using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) in our releases.


## Dependencies and versioning
TJPCov currently runs on python 3.8, but python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 are supported.

TJPCov also has a few specific software versions hardcoded.  Please check the `pyproject.toml` file to see version requirements.
