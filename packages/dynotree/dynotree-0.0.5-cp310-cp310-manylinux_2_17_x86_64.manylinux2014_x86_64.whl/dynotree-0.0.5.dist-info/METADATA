Dynamic Kd-Tree in C++ and Python: Euclidean, SO(2), SO(3) and more!

The underlying KD-tree implementation is based on [bucket-pr-kdtree](https://github.com/jkflying/bucket-pr-kdtree), but dynotree supports non-Euclidean spaces and custom compound spaces. State spaces can be defined at both compile and runtime for both efficiency and flexibility.

The C++ library is header-only, with Eigen as single dependency, and we provide Python bindings for fast development and prototyping.


# Try it out!

## PYTHON

### PIP Package

```bash
pip3 install dynotree
```

A first example:
[rrt_free.py](test/python/rrt_free.py)

A second example:
[rrt.py](https://github.com/quimortiz/dyn_kdtree/blob/main/test/python/rrt.py)

### Python from source

## C++

Test and examples are in  [main.cpp](https://github.com/quimortiz/dyn_kdtree/blob/main/src/main.cpp)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/quimortiz/dyn_kdtree
cd dyn_kdtree
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```

use
```
./main --run_test=NAME_OF_TEST
```
to run only one example or test


# Development

## Create Python Package (locally)

Create wheels 
```
CMAKE_ARGS="-DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=1" python3 -m build
```
Wheels will be in `dist/` directory. Install the wheels with
(adjust package and python version accordingly)

```
pip3 install dist/dynotree-0.0.4-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl 
```



## Create Python Package and Upload to PYPI (locally)




## Create wheels

for publishing in pypi
```bash
docker pull quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64 /io/build-wheels.sh
python3 -m twine upload wheelhouse/*
```

upload to  testpypi
```bash
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi wheelhouse/*
```


for creating local package:
```bash
TODO
```
