### Prerequisites

- Conda (miniconda3/anaconda) - env management
- Poetry - package management



### __Installing Package__

When I upload to pip:

```bash
pip install humbldata
```

Current install method:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jjfantini/humbldata.git
```

<details>
<summary><b>Development: Setup Conda Environment (w/Poetry)</b></summary>
<p>

This project uses a conda environment. I have done this to be able to use openbb
package easily. I have followed the instructions on the 
[openbb](https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/installation/pypi) website.

1. I created the environment with a `--prefix` and not a name, to ensure that it installed in my project directory, not the default path. This is executed in the project root dir.

    ```bash
    conda env create --prefix ./obb  --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/main/build/conda/conda-3-10-env.yaml
    ```

 2. I didn't want the full path to be displayed when using this env so I changed my `.condarc` file to show the env name as the last directory where the env is located.

    ```bash
    conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'
    ```
 3. Activate the environment

    ```bash
    conda activate ./obb
    ```
 4. Check if poetry is installed

    ```bash
    poetry --version
    # Install with `pip install poetry --upgrade`
    ```
 5. Install Packages from `poetry.lock`

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
 6. If you get an error: 
    ```
    EnvCommandError
    
    Command ['c:\\Users\\<user>\\<path>\\obb\\python.exe', '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', 'charset-normalizer', '-y'] errored with the following return code 2
    ```
    Then run:
    ```
    pip install charset-normalizer --upgrade
    ```
    and re-run!
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Development: Setup Conda Environment (w/o Poetry)</b></summary>
<p>

  If you do not use `poetry` for some weird reason, I keep the updated environment specs in an `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`file in the root of the project.

  I use keep the env. specs up to date. This is packaged in a file `update_reqs.py`

  ```bash
  conda env export | python -c "import sys; print(''.join(line for line in sys.stdin if 'prefix: ' not in line))" > environment.yml
  # This cmd removes the 'prefix:' line to be platform independent.
  conda list  --export > requirements.txt
  ```

  ### __Setup Conda Env (w/ requirements)__

  This method will be installing dependencies from `requirements.txt || environment.yml`

  ### __Steps__

  There are two methods to recreating the environment:

  * Using requirements.txt

      ```bash
      conda create --name obb --file requirements.txt
      ```

  * Using environment.yml (has my path prefix-check the file to change path prefix)

      ```bash
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      ```
