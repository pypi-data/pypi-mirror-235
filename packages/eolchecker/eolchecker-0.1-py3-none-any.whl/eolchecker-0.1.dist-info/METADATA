# EOL checker

EOL Checker is a simple application which gathers EOL information for software and hardware and allows you to query locally.

The latest version is `0.1`.

**Note** On the first use and after 7 days of expiry period, the database will be updated automatically. This is by design and cause slow start due to data download and database initiation.

## Getting Started

Install using `pip` or `pipx` ([recommended](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)):

```bash
pip install eolchecker

#OR
pipx install eolchecker
```

Get help about usage:

```bash
usage: eolchecker [-h] [--software QUERY_SOFTWARE] [--hardware QUERY_HARDWARE] [-u]

Query EOL software or hardware.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --software QUERY_SOFTWARE
                        Query the software by name
  --hardware QUERY_HARDWARE
                        Query the software by name
  -u, --update          Updates the local database. When combined with a query, it updates the database before running the query.
```
