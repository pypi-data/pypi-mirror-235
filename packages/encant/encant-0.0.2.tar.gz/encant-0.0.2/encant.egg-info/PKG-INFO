# encant: Uber Simple Python Version Management

----

Built in spite of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and inspired by [rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye), encant does one thing and one thing only: downloads standalone python builds. Builds come from indygreg's [repo](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone).

## Usage

1. install encant
`pipx install encant`
1. install a python version (or two)

    ```bash
    $ encant 3.10
    major.minor only version detected, pulling latest: 3.10.13
    3.10.13 written to /Users/aaron/.snakes/3.10.13
    ```

That's it! You can now use python however you need to, e.g.:
`$ $HOME/.snakes/3.10.13/bin/python3 -m venv .venv`
