Version 0.2.9 (2023-01-05)
--------------------------

* Skip a build when output directory exists with flag ``--skip-if-outputdir-exists``.


Version 0.2.8 (2022-07-20)

Version 0.2.7 (2022-07-20)
--------------------------

* Detect latest release, generate HTML redirection page.


Version 0.2.6 (2022-06-10)
--------------------------

* Keep track of released versions
* Pass `smv_latest_version` explicitly when calling Sphinx builder.
* Generate a HTML page which redirects to the latest version of docs.


Version 0.2.5 (2022-06-10)
--------------------------

* The original repo seems to be no longer maintained. There were new commits since the latest release `0.2.4`; this release includes all of them.
* When reading metadata from `conf.py`, value `release` is now set to the name of git reference point.


Version 0.2.4 (2020-08-12)
--------------------------

* Skip file existence check for the :file:`.` directory. This fixes an issue if the configuration or source directory is in the local path but reported as missing, because ``git cat-file -e`` always reports an error in that case. (`#12 <issue12_>`_)
* Fix file existence check not working on Windows. (`#18 <issue18_>`_, `#19 <issue19_>`_)
* Fix bug in the sphinx extension which tried to load the `conf.py` from the source directory instead of the conf directory. This could lead to problems when the two directories differ. (`#11 <issue11_>`_, `#13 <issue13_>`_)
* Fix wrong import in :file:`__main__.py` that prevented invocation using ``python -m sphinx_multiversion``. (`#23 <issue23_>`_)
* Fix failure to find refs if ``sphinx-multiversion`` was not invoked from the root of the git repository. (`#24 <issue24_>`_, `#25 <issue25_>`_, `#26 <issue26_>`_)
* Resolve issues with Sphinx extensions and Python modules not being reloaded when parsing the different :file:`conf.py` files. Now, each config file is parsed in it's own process, and the build is performed using the ``subprocess`` module instead of doing it all from the context of the main module. Python's `interpreter flags <pythonflags_>`_ (e.g. isolated mode) are passed through to the subprocesses. (`#22 <issue22_>`_, `#28 <issue28_>`_, `#30 <issue30_>`_, `#36 <issue36_>`_)
* Rewrite the path handling of the Sphinx extension to handle branch names containing a forward slash properly on Windows and add unittests and Windows CI builds to make sure it doesn't break on future updates. (`#31 <issue31_>`_, `#35 <issue35_>`_)


Version 0.2.3 (2020-05-04)
--------------------------

* Fixed return codes of main() function and exit with non-zero status if no matching refs were found.
* Added some logging calls to the git module.
* Fixed bug where local branch was used to check the existence of files on remote branches.


Version 0.2.2 (2020-05-01)
--------------------------

* Added additional checks to determine if a branch or tag contains both the Sphinx source directory and the :file:`conf.py` file. If that's not the case, that branch or tag is skipped automatically and not copied to the temporary directory. (`#9 <issue9_>`_)


Version 0.2.1 (2020-04-19)
--------------------------

* Fixed handling of absolute output paths in `vpathto` and ensure that all generated paths are relative.


Version 0.2.0 (2020-04-19)
--------------------------

* Added a way to override config variables using placeholders that expand to each version's actual value (`#4 <issue4_>`_, `#7 <issue7_>`_).


Version 0.1.1 (2020-03-12)
--------------------------

* Fixed version number in documentation
* Fixed issue that caused the wrong configuration directory being used when the ``-c`` argument was not specified on the command line


Version 0.1.0 (2020-03-11)
--------------------------

* Initial release
