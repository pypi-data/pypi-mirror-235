===========================
sphinx-multiversion-contrib
===========================

Sphinx extension for building self-hosted versioned docs.

This extension aims to provide a clean implementation that tries to avoid
messing with ``sphinx`` internals as much as possible.

Documentation can be found at: `https://iqm-finland.github.io/sphinx-multiversion-contrib/ <https://iqm-finland.github.io/sphinx-multiversion-contrib/>`_

----

This is a fork of the original project `sphinx-multiversion <https://github.com/Holzhaus/sphinx-multiversion/>`_. The fork was made at version ``0.2.4``, and all newer versions
represent new features and bug fixes. See ``CHANGELOG.rst`` for details.
