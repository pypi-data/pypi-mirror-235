## velocitous markup language
(Totally not related with [VML-SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language)\)  
This is a JSON parser for a markup language, if you want to call it like that, that i found myself using while jolting notes in the ~~fastest~~ *most velocitous*, and laziest way that i could think of... It goes pretty much like this:  
```
element 1
	things
		dog
		[x] snacks
			[ ] apple
			pear
		house
	names
		james
		alfred
[ ] element 2
	foo
	bar
	baz
foobar
```
That translates to this bulky JSON. You see, it makes JSON look bulky!!!  
```
[
    {
        "element 1": [
            {
                "things": [
                    "dog",
                    {
                        "snacks": [
                            {
                                "apple": [],
                                "checked": false
                            },
                            "pear"
                        ],
                        "checked": true
                    },
                    "house"
                ]
            },
            {
                "names": [
                    "james",
                    "alfred"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "element 2": [
            "foo",
            "bar",
            "baz"
        ],
        "checked": false
    },
    "foobar"
]
```
vml uses tabs to differentiate the hierarchical level of the current line... i think you got what i mean. Plus, you can also add checkboxes to every line with "[ ]", and you can check it with "[x]", and all this translates to a "checked" property in the JSON representation. It's easy to write vml with vi, for example you might check an empty checkbox with ```rx``` and move around tabulations efficiently with ```>>``` or ```<<```. In fact, this should really have been called tml, as in *tab markup language*, but unfortunately, that resembled too much TOML, dammit you Tom!!  
Install this with ```pip3 install vml-parser```.  
import it with ```from vml_parser import vml```, so you that you can access the ```vml.parse(s : list[str]) -> list[Element]``` method. A list of Elements gives you a middleware representation of what's in your vml. You might, vice versa, build up programmatically your list of Elements, and ```vml.dump(obj: list[Element]) -> list[str]``` for a later use. You now can also dump a list of JSON strings to a vml-formatted list of lines with ```vml.dumps(lines: list[str]) -> list[str]```.  
You will also get the ```vml``` command line script for free! (it pairs neatly with the ```jq``` cli). You can pipe it to stdout or you can pass it any number of filenames for it to read, and with ```-d``` you can use the included JSON to vml dumper. Have fun with it laying crazy pipes like ```... | vml | vml -d | vml | vml -d | ...```!!  
Now there is also a `-m` or `--markdown` option to convert vml to markdown. This is to be compliant with [extended markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids). When passing a single file, top level elements will be converted to a `h1` header, and subelements to `h2` headers. When passing multiple files, each file name will be a `h1` header, where `_` and `-` are replaced with ` `. All other sub elements will be converted to list items, indented accordingly.  
With pandoc, when converting to html or pdf, latex math works (with --mathjax) with elements that are surrounded by `$` like `$\exp{x}$` and footnotes also work with `[^1]` and `[^1]:`.
