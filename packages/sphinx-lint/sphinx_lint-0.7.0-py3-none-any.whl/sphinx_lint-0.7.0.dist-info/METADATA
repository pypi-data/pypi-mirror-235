Sphinx Lint is based on [rstlint.py from
CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e0433c1e7/Doc/tools/rstlint.py).


## What is Sphinx Lint, what is it not?

`sphinx-lint` should:

- be reasonably fast so it's comfortable to use as a linter in your editor.
- be usable on a single file.
- not give any false positives (probably a utopia, but let's try).
- not spend too much effort finding errors that sphinx-build already finds (or can easily find).
- focus on finding errors that are **not** visible to sphinx-build.


## Known issues

Currently Sphinx Lint can't work with tables, there's no understanding
of how `linesplit` works in tables, like:

```rst
   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------+
   | Method                                  | Checks that                 | New in        |
   +=========================================+=============================+===============+
   | :meth:`assertEqual(a, b)                | ``a == b``                  |               |
   | <TestCase.assertEqual>`                 |                             |               |
   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------+
```

as Sphinx Lint works line by line it will inevitably think the `:meth:` role is not closed properly.

To avoid false positives, some rules are skipped if we're in a table.


## Contributing

A quick way to test if some syntax is valid from a pure
reStructuredText point of view, one case use `docutils`'s `pseudoxml`
writer, like:

```text
$ docutils --writer=pseudoxml tests/fixtures/xpass/role-in-code-sample.rst
<document source="tests/fixtures/xpass/role-in-code-sample.rst">
    <paragraph>
        Found in the pandas documentation, this is valid:
    <bullet_list bullet="*">
        <list_item>
            <paragraph>
                A pandas class (in the form
                <literal>
                    :class:`pandas.Series`
                )
        <list_item>
            <paragraph>
                A pandas method (in the form
                <literal>
                    :meth:`pandas.Series.sum`
                )
        <list_item>
            <paragraph>
                A pandas function (in the form
                <literal>
                    :func:`pandas.to_datetime`
                )
    <paragraph>
        it's documenting roles using code samples (double backticks).
```


## Releasing

First test with friends projects by running:

    sh download-more-tests.sh
    python -m pytest

Bump the version in `sphinxlint.py`, commit, tag, push:

    git tag v0.6.5
    git push
    git push --tags

To release on PyPI run:

    python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
    python -m build
    python -m twine upload dist/*
