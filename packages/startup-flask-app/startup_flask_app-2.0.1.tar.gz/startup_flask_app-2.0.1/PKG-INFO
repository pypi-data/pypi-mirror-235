# startup_flask_app

## Overview

`startup_flask_app` is a comprehensive Python library designed to streamline the development of Flask web applications by providing a pre-configured project structure and essential functionality. With `startup_flask_app`, developers can quickly create a foundation for their Flask-based web projects, saving time and effort.

## Features

- **Structured Project Setup:** `startup_flask_app` sets up your project with a well-organized directory structure, including templates and static folders, forms, and database configuration, so you can start building your web application without the hassle of manual configuration.

- **User Authentication:** The library includes user authentication functionality, allowing you to manage user accounts with ease. Users can register, log in, and perform various actions, with their data safely stored in the database.

- **Database Integration:** It integrates SQLAlchemy, providing a powerful and flexible way to work with databases. Create, update, and retrieve data from the database using the built-in model structure.

- **Web Forms with WTForms:** Forms are an essential part of web applications. With `startup_flask_app`, you can easily create and manage forms for user interactions, data submission, and more, using the popular WTForms library.

- **Flask Extensions:** `startup_flask_app` incorporates essential Flask extensions such as Flask-CKEditor, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Flask-WTF, enabling you to enhance your web application's functionality.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with `startup_flask_app`, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Package:**

   ```shell
   pip install startup-flask-app
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ArcadeDesigns/startup_flask_app.git
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It:**

   For Linux/Mac:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure the Flask Environment:**

   ```shell
   export FLASK_APP=app.py  # For Linux/Mac
   set FLASK_APP=app.py     # For Windows
   ```

6. **Initialize the Database:**

   ```shell
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

7. **Run the Application:**

   ```shell
   flask run
   ```

8. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view your running Flask application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application file where you can define your routes and application logic.

- **`models.py`**: Defines the data models for your application, which are managed through SQLAlchemy.

- **`forms.py`**: Contains form definitions using WTForms for handling user input and interactions.

- **`create_db.py`**: A script to create the initial database tables.

- **`database.py`**: Configuration file for your database connection using SQLAlchemy.

- **`packages.py`**: A script to activate the virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the Flask application.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the project's dependencies for easy installation.

- **`static/`**: This directory is where you can store your static assets such as CSS, JavaScript files, and images.

- **`templates/`**: Holds your HTML templates for different pages or components of your web application.

## Usage

1. **Customize the Application**: Edit `app.py`, `models.py`, and `forms.py` to tailor the application to your specific project requirements.

2. **Create Templates**: Develop HTML templates for your web application and place them in the `templates/` directory.

3. **Add Static Assets**: Store static assets like CSS files, JavaScript scripts, and images in the `static/` directory to enhance the user experience.

4. **Running the Application**: As previously mentioned, use the `flask run` command to start your application.

5. **Access Your Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to the local address `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access your Flask application.
