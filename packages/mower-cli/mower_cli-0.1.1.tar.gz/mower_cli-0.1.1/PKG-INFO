# Mower CLI

`mower-cli` is a command line utility which allow to resolve the mower problem.

## Specification

You can find the mower problem specification here: https://github.com/bpuertolas/mower-cli/tree/master/docs/specifications.md

### Assumptions:

Two assumptions were made because the specifications weren't clear enough on these subjects:
- All mowers are placed on the lawn before the first one starts to mow.
- After a mower finishes mowing, it stays at the last position.
- In the event of a mower collision, the program stops with an error.
