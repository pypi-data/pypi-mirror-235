### Features

- [#5284](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5284) [`5f25eb68`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/5f25eb6836f6a78ce6208b53495a01e1fc1a1d2f) - Minor bug fix sweep.  Thanks [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94)!/n  - Our use of __exit__ was catching errors and corrupting the traceback of any component that failed to instantiate (try running blocks_kitchen_sink off main for an example). Now the __exit__ exits immediately if there's been an exception, so the original exception can be printed cleanly/n  - HighlightedText was rendering weird, cleaned it up

## 0.2.0

### Highlights

#### Improve startup performance and markdown support ([#5279](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5279) [`fe057300`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/fe057300f0672c62dab9d9b4501054ac5d45a4ec))

##### Improved markdown support

We now have better support for markdown in `gr.Markdown` and `gr.Dataframe`. Including syntax highlighting and Github Flavoured Markdown. We also have more consistent markdown behaviour and styling.

##### Various performance improvements

These improvements will be particularly beneficial to large applications.

- Rather than attaching events manually, they are now delegated, leading to a significant performance improvement and addressing a performance regression introduced in a recent version of Gradio. App startup for large applications is now around twice as fast.
- Optimised the mounting of individual components, leading to a modest performance improvement during startup (~30%).
- Corrected an issue that was causing markdown to re-render infinitely.
- Ensured that the `gr.3DModel` does re-render prematurely.
