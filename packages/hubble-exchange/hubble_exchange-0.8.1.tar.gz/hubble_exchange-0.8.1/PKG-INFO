# Python SDK for Hubble Exchange

[Hubble Exchange](https://hubble.exchange) is a Layer 1 Blockchain for a Decentralised Perps OrderBook
<br>[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HubbleExchange)


## Installation

The simplest way is to install the package from PyPI:
```shell
pip install hubble-exchange
```

## Example usage:

All read/write functions are async
<br>Requires HUBBLE_RPC_HOST, HUBBLE_BLOCKCHAIN_ID, HUBBLE_ENV environment variable to be set
```shell
export HUBBLE_RPC_HOST=candy-hubblenet-rpc.hubble.exchange
export HUBBLE_BLOCKCHAIN_ID=iKMFgo49o4X3Pd3UWUkmPwjKom3xZz3Vo6Y1kkwL2Ce6DZaPm
export HUBBLE_ENV=hubblenext
```

```python
import os
from hubble_exchange import HubbleClient, OrderBookDepthResponse, LimitOrder, IOCOrder


async def main():

    async def callback(response):
        print(f"Received response: {response}")
        return response

    client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))

    # get a dict of all market ids and names - for example {0: "ETH-Perp", 1: "AVAX-Perp"}
    markets = await client.get_markets()

    # place limit orders
    limit_orders = []
    limit_orders.append(LimitOrder.new(3, 1, 1.2, False, False)) # market = 3, qty = 1, price = 1.2, reduce_only = False, post_only = False
    limit_orders.append(LimitOrder.new(0, 0.1, 1800, False, True)) # market = 0, qty = 0.1, price = 1800, reduce_only = False, post_only = True
    # placed_orders list will contain the order ids for the orders placed
    placed_orders = await client.place_limit_orders(limit_orders, True, callback)

    # place ioc orders
    ioc_orders = []
    ioc_orders.append(IOCOrder.new(3, 1, 1.2, False, 3)) # market = 3, qty = 1, price = 1.2, reduce_only = False, expiry = 3 seconds
    ioc_orders.append(IOCOrder.new(0, 0.1, 1800, False, 3)) # market = 0, qty = 0.1, price = 1800, reduce_only = False, expiry = 3 seconds
    # placed_orders list will contain the order ids for the orders placed
    placed_orders = await client.place_ioc_orders(ioc_orders, True, callback)

    # get limit order details - only works for open limit orders
    order_details = await client.get_limit_order_details(order.id, callback)

    # get status for limit orders - works for all order statuses
    order_status = await client.get_limit_order_status(order.id, callback)
    
    # cancel an order
    await client.cancel_limit_orders([order], True, callback)

    # order can also be cancelled by order id
    await client.cancel_order_by_id(order.id, True, callback)

    # get current order book for market = 1
    order_book = await client.get_order_book(1, callback)

    # get current margin and positions(uses the address for which private key is set)
    positions = await client.get_margin_and_positions(callback)

    # get order fills
    order_fills = await client.get_order_fills()

    # get all open orders
    open_orders = await client.get_open_orders(None, callback)
    # get open orders for market_id = 0

## Orderbook depth feed
Orderbook depth feed can be subscribed to using the `subscribe_to_order_book_depth` method. It emits the change in orderbook depth every second. It only emits the prices where the quantity has changed, but with absolute quantities(not the change).

```python
import os
from hubble_exchange import HubbleClient

async def main():
    client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))
    # subscribe to market id 0
    await client.subscribe_to_order_book_depth(0, callback=callback)
```

### OrderBookDepthUpdateResponse description
- T: timestamp
- symbol: market id
- bids: list of [price, quantity] for bids
- asks: list of [price, quantity] for asks


## Trader feed

All order updates related to a particular trader can be subscribed to using the `subscribe_to_trader_updates` method.
It can be subscribed in 2 confirmation modes - head block or accepted block. Events received in head block mode are not finalised and can be reverted. When an event is removed from the chain, the client will receive a `removed=True` event. Events received in accepted block mode are finalised and will alwats have `removed=False`.

```python
import os
from hubble_exchange import HubbleClient, ConfirmationMode

async def main():
    client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))
    await client.subscribe_to_trader_updates(ConfirmationMode.accepted, callback)
```


### TraderFeedUpdate description

- Trader: address of the trader
- OrderId: order id
- OrderType: order type - "limit" order or "ioc" (market order)
- Removed: whether the event is being removed or not
- EventName: name of the contract event (OrderAccepted|OrderRejected|OrderMatched|OrderCancelAccepted|OrderCancelRejected)
- Args: args is a dynamic field and it contains information about the event. For example, OrderPlaced event contains order object, OrderMatched event contains fillAmount and price
- BlockNumber: block number in which the transaction was included
- BlockStatus: (head|accepted) whether the block is accepted or only a preferred block(head block)
- Timestamp: timestamp of the block in unix format
- TransactionHash: transaction hash

#### EventName description
- OrderAccepted - Order was successfully placed
- OrderRejected - Order was rejected
- OrderMatched - Order was matched
- OrderCancelAccepted - Order was successfully cancelled(only for Limit orders)
- OrderCancelRejected - Order cancel was rejected(only for Limit orders)

Removed events are emmitted during chain reorgs, and are most likely to be temporary. They are only emmitted when subscribing to head block events. If removed=True, the client might need to do a reverse operation for the given event. For example if an OrderMatched event is received with removed=True, the client should add the fillAmount back to unfilled quantity of the order.

## Market feed

All trades of a particular market can be subscribed to using the `subscribe_to_market_updates` method.
Similar to the trader feed, it has 2 confirmation modes - head block or accepted block.

```python
import os
from hubble_exchange import HubbleClient, ConfirmationMode

async def main():
    client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))
    # subscribe to market id 0
    await client.subscribe_to_market_updates(0, ConfirmationMode.accepted, callback)
```

### MarketFeedUpdate description

- Trader: address of the trader who performed the trade
- Market: market id
- Size: size of the trade in decimals
- Price: price at which it was executed
- Removed: whether the event is being removed or not
- EventName: name of the contract event (PositionModified)
- BlockNumber: block number in which the transaction was included
- BlockStatus: (head|accepted) whether the block is accepted or only a preferred block(head block)
- Timestamp: timestamp of the block in unix format
- TransactionHash: transaction hash

Removed events are emmitted during chain reorgs, and are most likely to be temporary. They are only emmitted when subscribing to head block events. If removed=True, the client might need to do a reverse operation for the given event.


## Get limit order status

Get the status of a limit order. It can be used to get the status of any order, even if it is not placed using the sdk.

```python
order_status = await client.get_limit_order_status(order.id, callback)
```

### Status Description

```
Invalid = order does not exist
Placed = order is unfilled
PartiallyFilled = order is partially filled
Filled = order is completely filled
Cancelled = cancelled
```

## Open orders

Returns all open orders of the trader. It can be filtered by market id.

```python
# get all open orders
open_orders = await client.get_open_orders(None, callback)
# get open orders for market_id = 0
open_orders = await client.get_open_orders(0, callback)
```

### OpenOrder description

- Market: market id
- Price: order price
- Size: order size
- FilledSize: filled size
- Timestamp: timestamp of order place transaction in unix format
- Salt: order salt
- OrderId: order id
- ReduceOnly: whether the order is reduce-only or not
- PostOnly: whether the order is post-only or not
- OrderType: order type - "limit" order or "ioc" (market order)


## Get historical user trades

Returns all trades of the trader. It can be filtered by market id.

```python
# get user trades in all markets in a time range
await client.get_trades(None, 1691669740, 1691583340, callback)
# get user trades in market_id = 3 in a time range
await client.get_trades(3, 1691669740, 1691583340, callback)
```

### Trade description
- BlockNumber: block number in which the order match transaction was included
- TransactionHash: transaction hash
- Market: market id
- Timestamp: timestamp of the block in unix format
- TradedAmount: amount of the trade in decimals
- Price: price at which it was executed
- RealizedPnl: realized pnl of the trade in USD
- OpenNotional: open notional
- ExecutionMode: execution mode - "maker" or "taker"


## Get nonce

An account nonce is a transaction counter in each account, which is used to prevent replay attacks. Nonce should be increased by 1 in every transaction. The function `get_nonce` fetches the number of transactions sent by the address from the blockchain.

Nonce can be fetched once using `get_nonce` and be incremented in every subsequent transaction. However, if the same address is sending multiple transactions in parallel, it is recommended to use `get_nonce` before every transaction.

```python
nonce = await client.get_nonce()
# use this nonce in the next transaction like this
await client.place_limit_orders(orders, True, callback, {"nonce": nonce})
```

## Custom transaction options

The following options can be passed to the client to override the default

```python
{
    "nonce": Nonce,
    "gas": int,
    "maxFeePerGas": Union[str, Wei],
    "maxPriorityFeePerGas": Union[str, Wei],
},
```

It can be used for `place_limit_orders`, `cancel_limit_orders`, `cancel_order_by_id` methods.
Example:
```python

from web3 import Web3

client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))
placed_orders = await client.place_limit_orders(orders, callback, {
    "gas": 500_000,
    "maxFeePerGas": Web3.to_wei(80, 'gwei'),
    "maxPriorityFeePerGas": Web3.to_wei(20, 'gwei'),
})
```

## Transaction modes

There are different modes in which the client can wait for acknowledgement of the transaction. The default behaviour is to send the transaction and not wait for the acknowledgement.
This can be changed by explicitly asking the function to wait while sending the trasaction.

- TransactionMode.no_wait: The default behaviour is to send transactions to the blockchain and NOT wait for the acknowledgement.
- TransactionMode.wait_for_head: Wait for the transaction to be included in the canonical chain. At this time the block is preferred but not yet finalized. However, once the block in included in the canonical chain, the matching engine will start processing the order.
- TransactionMode.wait_for_accept: Wait for the transaction to be finalised.

Example:
```python
from hubble_exchange import TransactionMode
client = HubbleClient(os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY"))
placed_orders = await client.place_limit_orders(orders, callback, mode=TransactionMode.wait_for_accept)

# or set the default mode for all transactions

client.set_transaction_mode(TransactionMode.wait_for_head)
```

---

## Waiting for response in place_limit_orders and cancel_limit_orders

The `place_limit_orders`, `place_ioc_orders`, and `cancel_limit_orders` methods can be called in 2 modes - wait for response or don't wait for response.
To get the acknowledgement of the transaction, use `wait_for_response=True`. The response will be a list of dicts with order ids and success boolean. Waiting for response will be slower because this can be confirmed only after the transaction is mined(accepted).
When using `wait_for_response=True`, the sdk will automatically set the transaction mode to `TransactionMode.wait_for_accept` because the response can be confirmed only after the transaction is mined.

Alternatively, the client can also use trader feed to listen to all the updates. This is faster when done with ConfirmationMode.head


## Config

- mininum_quantity: minimum quantity that can be placed in an order for a particular market. The quantity also has to be a multiple of this number.
- price_precision: number of decimal places for price for a particular market.

```python
from hubble_exchange.constants import get_minimum_quantity, get_price_precision

# get minimum quantity for market id 3
min_qty = get_minimum_quantity(3)
# get price precision for market id 3
price_precision = get_price_precision(3)
```
