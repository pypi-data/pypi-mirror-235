      Devito is a tool for performing optimised Finite Difference (FD)
      computation from high-level symbolic problem definitions. Devito
      performs automated code generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation
      based on symbolic equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly
      optimised Finite Difference stencil kernels on multiple computer platforms.
