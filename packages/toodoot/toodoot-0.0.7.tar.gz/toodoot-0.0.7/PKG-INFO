# Toodoot

Todo is a simple TUI for tasks lists in markdown files.

Run the command on a new file, existing file, or the default 'todo.md'

If you open an existing file, it will ignore non task list markdown, but will display headers in the app.

## Install
You can install toodoot from pip, the package is on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/toodoot/)

> pip install toodoot

(You might have to run pip3 install toodoot, on some systems python/pip refers to python2, not 3)
