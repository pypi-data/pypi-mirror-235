# CLI

A CLI (or command line interface) is a type of script you can run in the terminal.

## Frameworks

While frameworks are not required to implement a CLI in Python, they might provide a better structure and useful utilities which make them worth exploring:

- [click]
- [typer]: based on click, integrates with type annotations
