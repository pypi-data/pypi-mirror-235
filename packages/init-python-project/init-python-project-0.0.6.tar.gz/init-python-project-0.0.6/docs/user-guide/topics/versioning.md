# Versioning

The version is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file:

{{ includex("docs/examples/default/pyproject.toml", start_match="Version", end_match="version =", end_offset=1, code=True, caption=True)}}

## Semantic Versioning

This template proposes to follow [semantic versioning][] guidelines. It provides information about the scope of changes between releases while being simple enough to understand and use. It is widely used across software projects and many tools use semantic versioning by default.
