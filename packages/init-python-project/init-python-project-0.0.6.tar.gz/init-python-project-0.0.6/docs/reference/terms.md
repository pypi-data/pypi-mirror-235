# Terminology

## Git

remote
:   A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or GitLab.

## Python

module
:   A Python module corresponds to a Python source file with the `*.py` ending.

package
:   A directory that is marked as a Python package by containing a `__init__.py` file. An exception to this are [namespace packages][], which don't require such an indicator.

reStructuredText
:   Markup language used by [Sphinx][]. A more common alternative is [Markdown][].
