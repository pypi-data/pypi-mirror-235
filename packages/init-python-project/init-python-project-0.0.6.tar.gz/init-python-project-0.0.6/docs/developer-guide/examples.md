# Example Projects

As the copier template requires familiarity with Jinja to be deciphered, a static example project is generated based on this template. It serves as a reference of how projects generated from this template look like.

By forking (or copying from) the example project, users can benefit from this template without using or even knowing about copier.

Using the example project directly makes it simpler but also less convenient for users, as they won't benefit from dynamic configuration of their individual project based on this template's questionnaire shown in [Creating your first project][creating-your-first-project].

An example project generated using default values is available on all [supported remotes][supported-remotes].

In addition, internal example projects are generated to be referenced in this documentation.
