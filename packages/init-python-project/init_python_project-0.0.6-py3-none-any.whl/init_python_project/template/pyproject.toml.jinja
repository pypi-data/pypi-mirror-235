# This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
# package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
# users can install this project, e.g.:
#
# $ pip install sampleproject
#
# And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/

# There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
# specification here:

# Versions should comply with PEP 440:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
