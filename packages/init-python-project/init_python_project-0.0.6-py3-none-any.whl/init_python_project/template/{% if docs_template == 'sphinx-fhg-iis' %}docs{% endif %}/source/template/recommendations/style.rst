   The `Fraunhofer Schreibregeln`_ consist of an `Editorial Style Guide`_. 
   Please refer to this guide for keywords, Fraunhofer wording and translations 
   as well as general style recommendations. An excerpt of the document can be found below.

   Please also refer to the `AMEs writing guidelines`_.

Equal opportunity and inclusion
-------------------------------------
The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft is committed to language that is unambiguous, inclusive,
legally compliant and appropriate for the target audience. In addition to the scientific
community, our communication specifically targets political stakeholders, industry and
business clients, the media and the general public. How we communicate is a very
important factor in our business and the success of our modern, inclusive organization.

Pillars of inclusion in communication include respect for gender, abilities and
background. 

Gender inclusiveness
------------------------
Use gender-neutral language in all publications and written material as well as in all
media. Select neutral terms. For example, instead of ``deputy chairman``, ``man-made``
or ``maternity leave`` use ``deputy chair``, ``synthetic`` or ``human-made``, ``parental
leave`` etc.

Do not use gender-specific pronouns when the gender is unknown or irrelevant.
The plural pronouns ``they/their/theirs`` are now acceptable replacements for
``he/him/his`` or ``she/her/hers.``

Passive
-----------------------------
Avoid using passive sentence constructions.

Wording and spelling in AME

- if plural is used and generated regular: many users’ experience …
- if singular is used: the first user’s experiences
- 3D audio setup and MPEG-H 3D Audio standard (capital only when in conjunction with MPEG-H)
- these metadata are (plural)
- when bullet points are part of a sentence, separated by ","
- when bullet points are just plain list, no ","
- plug-in (with dash)
- In a sentence that lists items, please use the serial comma (Oxford comma) to prevent (un)intentional misunderstandings. If you are unsure, please check here, here or with the Marcom department.
- "Dialogue" is the translation of "Dialog", "Dialog+" the name of the MPEG-H production technology - please be aware of the spelling!
- "Preset" can be used in two different ways that are spelled differently: a non-MPEG-H preset, a preset in general = preset (lower case p). An MPEG-H-related preset (cf. production tools, MPEG-H Info Tool etc.) is treated like a name and becomes Preset (upper case P).
