**Simulation decomposition** or **SimDec** is an uncertainty and sensitivity
analysis method, which is based on Monte Carlo simulation. SimDec consists of
three major parts:

1. computing sensitivity indices,
2. creating multi-variable scenarios and mapping the output values to them, and
3. visualizing the scenarios on the output distribution by color-coding its segments.

SimDec reveals the nature of causalities and interaction effects in the model.

## Python API
The library is distributed on PyPi and can be installed with:

    pip install simdec

To install the development version, download the source and from the root of
the repository:

    pip install -e .[dev]

## Dashboard
A live dashboard is available at:

https://simdec.io

### Local use

The dashboard can be run locally using:

    make serve

### Deployment

The live version of the dashboard is hosted on GCP. To deploy a new version:

    PANEL_TOKEN=... make production
