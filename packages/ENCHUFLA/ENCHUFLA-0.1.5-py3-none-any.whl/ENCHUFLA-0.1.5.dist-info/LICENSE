SOLAR SYSTEM DEVOURER LICENSE


THIS IS A BEING CAPABLE OF DEVOURING
ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEMS WITH ONE BITE.

THE BEING WAS DISCOVERED WITHIN THE
LIMITS OF A GALAXY THAT YOU HAVE
INDISPUTABLE CLAIM TO.

NO RECORDS HAVE BEEN FOUND ABOUT THE 
ANATOMY OR ANCESTRY OF THE BEING.


FIRST CONTACT WITH THE BEING WAS 
MADE A FEW DEGREES AFTER AN APHELION
ON YOUR HOME PLANET.

THE BEING PROBABLY ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS,
HOWEVER ONE OF YOUR PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS
IS IN NEED OF REPAIR.

LUCKILY, THE BEING SEEMS TO TAKE REALLY
SLOW BITES.
