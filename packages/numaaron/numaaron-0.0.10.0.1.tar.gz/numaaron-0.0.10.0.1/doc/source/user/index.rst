.. Links to these files are placed directly in the top-level html
   (doc/source/_templates/indexcontent.html, which appears for the URLs
   numaaron.org/devdocs and numaaron.org/doc/XX) and are not in any toctree, so
   we include them here to avoid a "WARNING: document isn't included in any
   toctree" message
