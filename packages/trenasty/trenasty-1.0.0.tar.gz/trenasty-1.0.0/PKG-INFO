Treblle is a lightweight SDK that helps Engineering and Product teams build, ship & maintain REST based APIs faster.

## Features

- [API Monitoring & Observability](https://www.treblle.com/features/api-monitoring-observability)
- [Auto-generated API Docs](https://www.treblle.com/features/auto-generated-api-docs)
- [API analytics](https://www.treblle.com/features/api-analytics)
- [Treblle API Score](https://www.treblle.com/features/api-quality-score)
- [API Lifecycle Collaboration](https://www.treblle.com/features/api-lifecycle)
- [Native Treblle Apps](https://www.treblle.com/features/native-apps)


## How Treblle Works
Once youâ€™ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score thatâ€™s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when youâ€™re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://app.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK
We have two installation approaches for the SDK. There are instructions for you to access it **globally** and **locally**.

### Local Installation

For the local installation of FastApi
- Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Certifieddonnie/treblle-dynasty.git 
```
- Change directory to **treblle-dynasty**

```
cd treblle-dynasty 
```
- Run **install.sh**
```
./install.sh
```
- Then go ahead and create a **.env** file which should compulsorily have the following variables alongside others that you'll specify in your app.

```
TREBLLE_API_KEY = ''
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID = ''
TIME_ZONE = ''
TREBLLE_SENSITIVE_KEYS = []
#[id, access_token, email]

```
**Sensitive keys here are to be masked, you can add id, access_token, email and any other details you would want to keep masked**

- Then go ahead and follow the [Initialization](#initialization) process

### Global Installation
You can install Treblle for FastAPI globally, by following the commands below.
```
pip install trenasty

``` 

Then go ahead and create a **.env** file which should compulsorily have the following variables alongside others that you'll specify in your app.

```
TREBLLE_API_KEY = ''
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID = ''
TIME_ZONE = ''
TREBLLE_SENSITIVE_KEYS = []
#[id, access_token, email]

```
**Sensitive keys here are to be masked, you can add id, access_token, email and any other details you would want to keep masked**

### Initialization

This is the step to initialize the middleware in your FastAPI app.

**Importing FastAPI in Treblle Middleware**
```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from trenasty.middleware.treblle import TreblleMiddleware
```

**Instantiating the App and the Middleware**
```
app = FastAPI()

app.middleware("http")(TreblleMiddleware(app))

```
