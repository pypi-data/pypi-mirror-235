# sparsecca

Python implementations for Sparse CCA algorithms. Includes:

* Sparse (multiple) CCA based on Penalized Matrix Decomposition (PMD) from Witten et al, 2009.
* Sparse CCA based on Iterative Penalized Least Squares from Mai et al, 2019.  

One main difference between these two is that while the first is very simple it assumes datasets to be white.

## Installation

### sparsecca is available on PyPI

```
pip install sparsecca
```

### Iterative penalized least squares support

In addition to basic scientific packages such as numpy and scipy, iterative penalized least squares needs either glmnet\_python or pyglmnet to be installed.

## Usage

See examples, https://teekuningas.github.io/sparsecca

## Acknowledgements

Great thanks to the original authors, see Witten et al, 2009 and Mai et al, 2019.
