The project is a development platform designed for [Media Computation](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mjguz/mediacomp/mediaComp-teach/). It offers a pure Python implementation of [gatech-csl/jes](https://github.com/gatech-csl/jes), aiming to ensure consistent API functionality across both implementations. Notable enhancements beyond the foundational versions are detailed in subsequent sections. This package is compatible with any Python3.10^ version, allowing students to utilize the Python programming language to manipulate multimedia components, including images, sounds, and videos over online repl providers. The current API documentation aligns with the JES usage described in the reference book, and the functions implemented to date are provided here.

This library was developed for the Introduction to Computer Science (CSIS 110) course at Siena College, as well as the college's affiliated high school computer science programs.
