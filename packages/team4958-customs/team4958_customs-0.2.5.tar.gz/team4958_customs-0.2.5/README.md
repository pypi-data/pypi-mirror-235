## About The Project

You probably think that some necessary boring stuff is inevitable and it will always be a part of the process.
We didn't want to agree with it so we created this library which transforms completing the most boring and pissing off tasks to few python strings.

## Getting Started


### Installation

```sh
#Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install team4958-customs

#Windows
py -3 -m pip install team4958-customs
```
