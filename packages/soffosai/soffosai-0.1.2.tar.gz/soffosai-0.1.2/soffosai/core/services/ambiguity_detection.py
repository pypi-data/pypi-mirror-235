    This module finds statements or sentences in text that are not coherent, or can
    be interpreted in multiple ways while also taking in account the surrounding
    context. For example, "The fisherman went to the bank" would be identified as
    ambiguous, but "The fisherman went to the bank to draw money" won't. It accepts
    parameters to control the way the text is segmented for processing. It gives an
    explanation as to why a span of text is considered ambiguous. Despite taking in
    account the context of each span, the module may sometimes be strict in what it
    considers ambiguous, even if the combination of words mean something very
    specific most of the time. A very fascinating tool for writers that can be used
    to inspire, write more understandable content, or even to just delve into the
    remarkable nuances and complexities hidden in human language and thought
