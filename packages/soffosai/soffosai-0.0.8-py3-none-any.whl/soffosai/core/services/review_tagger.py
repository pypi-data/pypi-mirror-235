    This module extracts key information from negative product reviews. It attempts to find 
    the referred object, it's fault and an action/verb that is associated with it. If any 
    of the information is not present, it returns "n/a". This is useful for organizations who 
    want to analyze product reviews in order to identify and prioritize the most important issues.
