    The Q&A Generation module splits large documents in chunks from which it generates multiple 
    question-answer pairs. The chunk length is configurable. Usually more questions can be generated 
    when segmenting the text to smaller chunks, while longer chunks help retain more context, in cases 
    where a topic is discussed over multiple sentences in the context. To address cases where the topic 
    is split mid-way, the module supports overlapping the chunks by a configurable amount of sentences. 
    This gives a lot of flexibility to cater to your specific use case.
