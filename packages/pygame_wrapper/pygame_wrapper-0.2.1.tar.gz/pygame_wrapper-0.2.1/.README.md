## Introduction

This is a project that I created in order to have an easier time when creating games with pygame, its not perfect but it really helps lowering some of the annoying boilerplate of pygame. 
This project has pygame-ce listed as a requirement, thus meaning that when installed from PyPI it will automatically install pygame-ce. 
This is because I believe it is superior than pygame. 
Normal pygame *should* work but you will have to manually uninstall pygame-ce and install pygame.
If you have normal pygame and find issues with the code, you will not get any support (at least from me).

## Installation

```console
pip install pygame_wrapper
```

## Documentation

Due to me being lazy, documentation is non-existent.
PRs for docs are welcome (modify DOCS.md).
If this project gets big enough I will redo my code to allow automatic documentation to work, or just actually make docs.
