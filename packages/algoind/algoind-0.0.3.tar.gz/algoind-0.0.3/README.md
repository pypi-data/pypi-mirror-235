# ‚úÖ Example: How to use it

```sh
# After the installation of the package:
import algoind
from algoind import indicators as ind

# Let's try SMA: what should we know about it?
help(ind.SMA)

# Let's try SMA that takes, for example:
# - The close prices of a df: "df.Close"
# - The period for the calculation of the SMA: "20"
SMA20 = ind.SMA(df.Close, 20)

# To see the values of the indicator:
SMA20
```
# ‚öôÔ∏è Discussion and Development
I will be very enthusiastic if somebody would like to help me with this project.
