# üîé What is it

- **algoind** is python3 package that contains technical indicators for backtesting and for implementing trading strategies in Python3.

- ### üòÉ Who I am
  - My name is Matteo, a 21 years old FinTech student.
  - I created this library for my personal usage and I decided publish it because it think can be useful for someone.
  - üëã You can find my [contacts here].

- The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/matteoincremona/algoind/

- Thanks to [Investopedia.com] that provided me a vast amount of knowledge to be able to create this library.

# üíª How to Install it
```sh
# conda
conda install -c conda-forge algoind
```

```sh
# PyPI
pip install algoind
```

# üìà Features 
This is the list of all the indicators **algoind** contains:

  - Single Moving Average (**SMA**)
  - Esponential Moving Average (**EMA**)
  - Average True Range (**ATR**)
  - Relative Strenght Index (**RSI**)
  - Upper Bollinger Bands (**BBU**)
  - Lower Bollinger Bands (**BBL**)
  - Mid Bollinger Bands (**BBM**)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (**MACD**)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence Signal (**MACDsignal**)

# ‚úÖ Example: How to use it

```sh
# After the installation of the package:
import algoind
from algoind import indicators as ind

# Let's try SMA: what should we know about it?
help(ind.SMA)

# Let's try SMA that takes, for example:
# - The close prices of a df: "df.Close"
# - The period for the calculation of the SMA: "20"
SMA20 = ind.SMA(df.Close, 20)

# To see the values of the indicator:
SMA20
```
# ‚öôÔ∏è Discussion and Development
I will be very enthusiastic if somebody would like to help me with this project.
