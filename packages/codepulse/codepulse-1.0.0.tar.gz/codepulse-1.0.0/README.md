## What is codepulse?

**codepulse** is a Python package designed to provide detailed insights into the execution time of your code at a granular level, line by line. By meticulously tracking the execution time of each line of code, codepulse helps you identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and gain a deeper understanding of your code's behavior.

## Main Features

- Precisely measures the execution time of each line of code within a function.
- Generates informative visualizations that highlight performance hotspots.
- Supports integration with popular Python development environments.
- Designed for ease of use and seamless integration into existing projects.


## Where to get it
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/codepulse-developers/codepulse

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## Installation

You can install codepulse using `pip`:

```
pip install codepulse
```
### Usage

Import the Tracker module from the `codepulse` package, create an instance of it by passing the function you want to track as a parameter, and then utilize this instance to invoke the tracked function. When you create an instance using `Tracker(fun1)`, it generates a wrapper around fun1 that effectively measures and records the execution time line by line.

```
from codepulse import Tracker

def fun1(x,y):
    m = 1
    for i in range(x*100):
        m = m * 3 
        for j in range(x*30):
            m = m + 4 
    return m 

t = Tracker(fun1)
t(3,5)
```
output:
```

  | 5          |     return m                      | nan                  | nan
