   [How to get the cauth value?](#CAUTH)

2. Browser cookies

   Just use the `--browser-cookie` option when running the program.

   Automatically extract CAUTH value from the browser cookie. If this method fails, please use other authentication methods.

3. Username and Password

   Just use the `-u <user> -p <pass>` options when running the program.

   Please note that this method will open the browser, you may have to click on the reCAPTCHA.

## Quick Start

Run the following command to query the usage and options:

```
coursera-helper --help
```

Run the following command to query the courses in which you are enrolled:

    coursera-helper -u <email or username> --list-courses

From there, choose the course you are interested in, copy its course name and use it
in the following command:

    coursera-helper -u <email or username> <COURSE NAME>

Your downloaded videos will be placed in current directory, but you can also choose another destination with the `--path` argument.

    coursera-helper --help


### Examples

General download:

```
coursera-helper -u <user> data-analysis-with-python
```

Download with subtitles:

```
coursera-helper -u <user> --subtitle-language en,zh-CN|zh-TW data-analysis-with-python
```

Specify video resolutionï¼š

```
coursera-helper -u <user> --video-resolution 720p data-analysis-with-python
```

Download with quizzes:

```
coursera-helper -u <user> --download-quizzes data-analysis-with-python
```

Download with notebooks:

```
coursera-helper -u <user> --download-notebooks data-analysis-with-python
```

Alternatively, if you want to store your preferred parameters (which might also include your username and password), create a file named `coursera-dl.conf` where the script is supposed to be executed, with the following format:

```
--username <user>
--password <pass>
--subtitle-language en,zh-CN|zh-TW
--download-quizzes
--download-notebooks
--video-resolution 720p
--download-delay 10
-cauth <cauth value>
```

If you have created a file named `coursera-dl.conf`, you just download course with command:

```
coursera-helper data-analysis-with-python
```
