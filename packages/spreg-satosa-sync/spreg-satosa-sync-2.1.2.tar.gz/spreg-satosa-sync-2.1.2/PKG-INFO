        ## Description
        
        Script to read clients attributes from perun rpc and write them to mongoDB.
        
        ## Install
        
        Install from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/spreg-satosa-sync/):
        
        ```sh
        pip install spreg-satosa-sync
        ```
        
        ## Configure
        
        Create a new config file from `config_template.yml`.
        
        This script uses the [perun.connector](https://pypi.org/project/perun.connector/) library. Because of this, you have to
        fill `adapters_manager` and `attrs_cfg_path` configuration options in your config file.
        `attrs_cfg_path` is a path to a yaml file which specifies mapping of attributes.
        You can find inspiration for the configuration in the `config_templates` directory of the perun.connector repository.
        
        ## Use
        
        The pip package registers a console entrypoint called `spreg_satosa_sync`, which you can call directly.
        
        The only argument is a path to config file:
        
        ```
        spreg_satosa_sync /etc/path/to/config.yml
        ```
