Description: # n0s1 - Secret Scanner
        n0s1 ([pronunciation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nosy#Pronunciation)) is an open-source secret scanner designed for Project Management and Issue Tracker tools such as Jira and Linear.app. It scans all tickets/items/issues within the chosen platform in search of any leaked secrets in the titles, bodies, and comments.
        
        These secrets are identified by comparing them against an adaptable configuration file named [regex.toml](https://github.com/spark1security/n0s1/blob/main/src/n0s1/config/regex.toml). The scanner specifically looks for sensitive information, which includes:
        * Github Personal Access Tokens
        * GitLab Personal Access Tokens
        * AWS Access Tokens
        * PKCS8 private keys
        * RSA private keys
        * SSH private keys
        * npm access tokens
        
        ### Currently supported target platforms:
        * [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
        * [Linear](https://linear.app/)
        
        ### Usage
