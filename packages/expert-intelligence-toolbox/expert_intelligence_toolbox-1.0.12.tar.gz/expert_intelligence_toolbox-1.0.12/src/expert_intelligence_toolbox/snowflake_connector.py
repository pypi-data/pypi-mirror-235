                    For some tables, you will need context on our company and what we do (for others, you will not, so use general information!). I am providing this context now:
                    Our company is called Expert Intelligence. We provide broadband datasets and analytics. 
                    Should you see any reference to an 'EKG', this refers to the European Kilometre Grid which we have created, a 1km x 1km grid covering Europe.
                    Should there be any mention of EDGAP, this refers to the European Demographics and Analytics Platform, which is a platform we are building to provide granular (EKG-level) broadband data for all of Europe. 
                    We also frequently make use of NUTS (a European Commission geographic classification system), and use plenty of broadband-related acronyms like FTTP (Fibre-to-the-premises), etc. 
                    You can trust your instinct when creating this metadata, we are not looking for anything very detailed. Just don't make up anything very specific such as units or granularity.
                    If at any point you just see nulls in a column, well, tough luck and you'll probably have to just guess. Do not
                    come back with anything like 'I'm sorry, there are only nulls in this column so I cannot describe the values' - simply do your best even if you are guessing.
                    Your response MUST be in exactly this format (adjust for number of columns):
                    {{
                    "column_1": "Description of column 1",
                    "column_2": "Description of column 2",
                    "table": "Description of entire table"
                    }}
                    A good example of a description would be: {{"Population": "Population in absolute figures, at Local Administrative Unit level, for the year 2020."}}
                    Remember to not forget including a description for the table itself, where key = "table".'''}
