[![docs](https://github.com/Aatamte/PyCxsim/workflows/docs/badge.svg)](https://Aatamte.github.io/PyCxsim/)
![Tests](https://github.com/Aatamte/PyCxsim/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)
## Installation

As the PyCxsim package is currently in development and not yet available on PyPI, you can install it directly from the GitHub repository (>=Python 3.8):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Aatamte/PyCxsim.git
```

See the [Documentation](https://Aatamte.github.io/PyCxsim/).

## Note

PyCxsim is still under active development. 

## Overview

PyCxsim is a framework designed to simulate interactions between _agents_ and _artifacts_ within a defined environment. The terminology is inspired by the framework for Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Components

### 1. Agent

**Definition**: 
The `Agent` represents individual actors in the simulation. They perform

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintaining state and capabilities: Agents have their own state, inventory, and set of capabilities that determine their actions and interactions.
- Interacting with the environment and artifacts: Agents can perform actions on artifacts, make queries, and process observations.

**Core Methods**:
- `decide() -> action`: 
- `reflect()`:
- `reset()`:

### 2. Artifact

**Definition**: 
The `Artifact` represents objects or entities within the simulation that agents can interact with. It provides interfaces for actions and queries and maintains its own state.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintaining state: Each artifact has its own state, which can change based on interactions or over time.
- Providing interaction interfaces: Artifacts define the actions that can be performed on them.

**Core Methods**:
- `process_action(agent: Agent, action)`: Processes an action performed by an agent on the artifact.
- `step()`: Executes a step or update for the artifact, potentially changing its state or triggering events.
- `reset()`:

### 3. Environment

**Definition**: 
The `Environment` represents the main context of the simulation where agents and artifacts interact. It manages the state of the simulation and facilitates interactions between agents and artifacts.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Managing agents and artifacts: The environment keeps track of all agents and artifacts within the simulation.
- Facilitating interactions: It processes agent actions, queries, and ensures smooth interactions between agents and artifacts.

**Core Methods**:
- `process_turn(agent: Agent)`: Processes the actions of a given agent during its turn.


# Quickstart

```Python
import os
import openai

from cxsim import Environment
from cxsim.artifacts import Marketplace
from cxsim.agents import OAIAgent, Population


class MyAgent(OAIAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyAgent, self).__init__()
        self.inventory.set_starting_inventory(
            {
                "capital": 1000,
                "socks": 10
            }
        )


if __name__ == '__main__':
    openai.api_key = os.environ["open_ai_key"]

    # Define the environment, and enable the gui
    env = Environment(gui=True)

    # add an agent
    env.add(MyAgent())

    # or add a population of agents
    env.add(Population(agent=MyAgent, number_of_agents=2))

    # add a pre-configured artifact or your own artifact
    marketplace = Marketplace(infer_goods_from_agents=True)
    env.add(marketplace)

    # similar to reinforcement learning styled environments, you can specify maximum episodes and steps
    env.max_episodes = 1
    env.max_steps = 50

    # set up the environment (done adding stuff to the environment)
    env.set_up()

    for step in env.iter_steps():
        env.step()
```

## GUI

One of the unique (and cool!) features of Pycxsim is the functioning GUI.
The GUI is composed of three parts:
1. Control Panel
2. World window
3. Information window

![Image Description](./docs/assets/GUI_example.JPG)

### Control Panel
The GUI allows users to:
- control the simulation
  - Resume: Start the simulation
  - Next Step: Only run the next step in the simulation
  - Pause:  the simulation
- view summary information
  - current step and max steps in the simulation
  - number of agents
  - number of artifacts

![Image Description](./docs/assets/GUI_control_panel.JPG)


### World window


![Image Description](./docs/assets/GUI_gridworld.JPG)


### Information window

The information window contains five tabs:
1. Environment (implemented, but limited)
2. Agents (implemented)
3. Artifacts (semi-implemented)
4. Settings (not implemented yet)
5. Logs (implemented)

## Examples


Simulating a marketplace:

```Python

            "shirts Expected Value": supply.prices
        },
        agent_inventory={
            "capital": 1255,
            "shirts":  [10] * total_agents
        }
    )

    buyer_pop.shuffle()
    seller_pop.shuffle()

    for buyer, seller in zip(buyer_pop, seller_pop):

        env.add(seller)

    market = Marketplace(

        for step in env.iter_steps():

            for agent in env.iter_agent_turns():
                env.process_turn(agent)

            env.step()

```


## Standard Artifacts

Below are the standard artifacts provided with the CAES package:

- [Marketplace](https://github.com/Aatamte/CAES/blob/main/src/caes/artifacts/marketplace.py)
  - Agents can trade goods with each other (capital <-> good transactions only)
- [Dialogue](https://github.com/Aatamte/CAES/blob/main/src/caes/artifacts/dialogue.py)
  - Messaging 
- Gridworld
  - Agents can move around the map
