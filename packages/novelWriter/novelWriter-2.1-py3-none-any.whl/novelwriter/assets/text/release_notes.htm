<h2>Release Notes for 2.1</h2>
<p><i>Released on 17 October 2023</i></p>

<p>The primary focus of this release has been a complete redesign of the Build Tool, that is, the
tool that assembles your project into a manuscript document. The new tool, called the "Manuscript
Build Tool" allows you to define multiple build definitions for your project. The build definitions
are edited in a new Manuscript Build Settings dialog, with a lot more options than the old tool.</p>
<p>The reason for this redesign is a long list of feature requests that could not easily be
accommodated in the old, much simpler tool. Far from all the features have been added yet, but now
that the new tool is in place, they will be gradually added in the coming releases.</p>
<p>The key feature added in this release is the extended control you now have for selecting exactly
what part of your project is included in a given build definition. You have the same filters for
selecting documents and notes, and turning on or off root folders as before, but you can now easily
override on a per-document basis what is included or excluded in addition to the filter.</p>
<p>A second major improvement is a better tool to format your manuscript headings. You no longer
have to look up formatting codes and add them manually. Instead, there is now a heading format
editor in the Build Settings dialog for creating the header format, with syntax highlighting
included.</p>

<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<p>Among other features is a new option to duplicate documents and folders in the project tree. The
duplicate feature is available from the right-click menu. A proper light colour theme has also been
added. In most cases it will be the same as the default theme, depending on your platform.</p>
<p>There are other, minor improvements as well, and a lot of code improvements under the hood. For
a full list of changes, see the detailed changelogs.</p>
