    Registering a saga with a name serves two purposes.  First, because the serialized
    saga is stored with its name, the name suggests what type the saga should be
    deserialized into.  Additionally, the name of the saga can be useful when
    examining logs and records when troubleshooting.  If no name is provided,
    the default implementation is:

        type.__module__ + "." + type.__name__
