class Saga:
    """Represents a distributed transaction.

    Sagas are a basic tool in distributed, event-driven systems.  An architectural
    constraint is that a command should be mapped to one and only one aggregate, but
    sometimes, a command that crosses aggregated boundaries is needed.  First, ensure
    that aggregate boundaries are properly defined, but in the case that they are,
    a separate component is needed to mediate the interaction between the various
    aggregates.  Think about the case where a financial transaction is made between two
    bank accounts, or an order is placed on a travel website which involves many moving
    parts.  These are examples of cases where a saga is needed.

    To implement a saga, extend from this class and create methods decorated with both
    `event_receiver` and `reconstitute_saga_state`.  `event_receiver` methods are
    invoked when a specific event arrives or when a saga is retried after a failure.
    `reconstitute_saga_state` methods reconstitute the saga's state whenever it is
    reinstantiated by the saga store.

    Sagas, like aggregates, are ephemeral.  Any state change that occurs in a saga must
    have a corresponding event.  For example, it is ubiquitous that when a saga is
    instantiated as a result of a new event, it will issue some command.  That the
    command was issued, successfully or not, is a state change that occurred in the
    saga, and as such, it requires a corresponding event such as 'CommandSucceeded' or
    'CommandFailed'.  Without this, when the saga is next instantiated, it will have no
    record that the command was ever issued and may mistakenly re-issue the command.
    The command should be idempotent, so in the ideal case, the worst outcome would be
    wasted resources rather than an error.

    In order to facilitate the saga's ability to know where it left off after being
    reinitialized in memory, the established pattern in this library involves an
    attribute on the saga called `flags` which is a set containing data (commonly types)
    that can be interrogated to know what was accomplished on previous instantiations of
    the saga.  The following two paragraphs explain features that make this easy to
    accomplish in practice.

    The `reconstitute_saga_state` decorator is used to decorate methods that
    rebuild the saga's state (which includes `flags`).  The decorator has a property
    called `add_event_type_to_flags` which defaults to True and will automatically add
    the type of the event being rebuilt to the `flags` collection.  This eliminates the
    need to write any code in the `reconstitute_saga_state` method in most simple cases.
    Don't forget to set the value to False if this behavior is not desired.  To
    illustrate (add_event_type_to_flags is specified here but is not needed since it
    defaults to True.):

        @reconstitute_saga_state(RequestApproved, add_event_type_to_flags=True)
        def handle_request_approved(self, event: RequestApproved):
            pass

    When a new event arrives, the corresponding method decorated with `event_receiver`
    is invoked.  The decorator provides a myriad of configuration options to interrogate
    `flags` to determine if the received should be invoked.  By default, the decorator's
    `require_event_type_in_flags` property is set to True.  You may have noticed that
    this seems silly since the reason this event receiver method is being invoked is
    that the event just arrived, but consider the case where the saga is instantiated
    because a command previously failed, and the saga was configured to retry after 30
    seconds.  In this case, there is no arriving event, so *ALL* event receiver methods
    are invoked.  In this case, interrogating `flags` is important to not accomplish
    steps that are already completed.  When authoring these event receivers, always
    consider the case where *EVERY* event receiver is invoked when the saga is
    instantiated rather than just the simple case where an event arrives.  There are
    various other attributes that can be set on the decorator to control whether or not
    an event receiver is invoked.

    When an invocation of an event receiver results in an exception, the event receiver
    will automatically set retry based on either the SAGA_RETRY_INTERVAL environment
    variable, the default value, or the value set in the decorator (listed in reverse
    order of precedence).

    A saga has a notion of a timeout (not to be confused with the retry mechanism).
    This is a period of time, after which, the saga will not progress, even if new
    events arrive.  A good way to handle timeouts is to put the timeout time in the
    event that triggers the saga in the first place.  Any other components involved in
    the saga's transaction should also be aware of the timeout and act accordingly.
    Other components in the system should NOT rely on the saga in order to receive a
    notification that the timeout is reached.

    When a saga is completed, call `set_complete` in the relevant event receiver.  To
    forcibly cause a saga to be timed out, use the `set_timeout` method which will take
    precedence over the `timeout_at` property.
