    ***Do not forget to register aggregates using the `RegisterAggregate` decorator.
    Failure to do so will prevent commands from being correctly mapped to the
    appropriate aggregate at runtime.

    See Fowler's Domain-Driven-Design,
    https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html.  For our purposes, it is best to
    think of an aggregate as a component that reconstitutes its state from persisted
    events, and uses that state to validate commands.  If the validation succeeds, one
    or more new events are created--these new events are not official until they are
    successfully persisted to an event store.

    Aggregates are ephemeral.  This short, but busy, life-cycle is managed by the
    `pyjangle.command.command_handler.handle_command` method.  For practical purposes,
    know that methods decorated with the `reconstitute_aggregate_state` decorator are
    used to reconstitute the aggregate's current state from the relevant events from the
    event store.  Commands are then validated against the rebuilt state via methods
    decorated with the `validate_command` decorator, and shortly thereafter, the
    aggregate is marked for garbage collection.

    It is crucial to know that the aggregate's state should NEVER be modified, only
    read, from methods decorated with `validate_command`.  The reason for this is that
    because aggregates are ephemeral, the only changes that will be 'remembered' on the
    next instantiation of the aggregate will be those changes that result from
    historical events read from the event store.  In other words, to modify the state of
    the aggregate, a `validate_command` method must publish new 'event candidates' via
    the `post_new_event` method.  These published events are not official until they are
    written to an event store, so it is an error to use them for any processing.
