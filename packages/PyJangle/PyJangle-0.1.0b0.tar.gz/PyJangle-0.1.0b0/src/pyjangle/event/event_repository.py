    The event repository serves as an infallibale source of truth--you could say that
    even if it's wrong, it's right. Events that are not yet committed are an opinion,
    and a committed event is a fact.  The underlying implementation ensures that the
    event store is always in a consistent state.  Some implementations may also serve as
    the event queue/bus which necessitates a mechanism for marking an event as having
    been 'completed' or 'handled' via the `mark_event_handled` method.

    The underlying implementation must also have some notion of a primary key to
    uniquely identify events which must be referenceable via the aggregate of an
    aggregate identifier and a version number.  This is the mechanism that creates the
    optimistic concurrency capability.  In other words, a `DuplicateKeyError` should be
    raised whenever an aggregate identifer + version has already been committed.
