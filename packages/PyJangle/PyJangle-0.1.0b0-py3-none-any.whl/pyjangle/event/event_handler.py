    """Decorates a function that handles a type of event.

    The default event dispatcher, `default_event_dispatcher` in the `event_dispatcher`
    module, dispatches events to functions that are decorated with this decorator based
    on `event_type`.  If the implementation of the handler executes without error, the
    dispatcher will mark the event as completed.  If an exception is thrown, the event
    will not be marked completed.  Multiple event handlers *can* be registered to the
    same type.  Multiple logical event handlers could also be combined into a single
    event handler.

    The most common implementations of event handlers will:
    - Upsert data into a database based on the payload of the event.  That data is
      eventually retrieved by a query.
    - Instantiates a saga to facilitate a distributed transaction between aggregates.
    - Execute a very simple transaction where a proper saga is not needed.

    An event handler that is not idempotent is an error.  There are several reasons why
    an event handler might be executed multiple times or even concurrently on a single
    unique event:
    - The handler's execution is sufficiently long that the event appears to need to be
      retried based on the timeout passed to `begin_retry_failed_events_loop` in the
      `event_daemon` module.
    - A message queue generally does not have a guarantee that you won't receive a
      message more that once under certain conditions.  This is rare, but it will happen
      eventually.
    - A system update or outage necessitates an event replay, so the event handler
      might execute upsert code even though a record already exists.
    - Trigger some action such as an e-mail or SMS.

    Event handlers should also assume that it may not receive events in order.  This is
    expected in an asynchronous distributed environment.
