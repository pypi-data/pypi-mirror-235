    Processing a command involves the following steps:
    - Map the command to an aggregate
    - Instantiate a blank aggregate
    - Retrieve and apply aggregate snapshot, if applicable
    - Retrieve and apply events from event store to reconstitute the aggregate state
    - Validate the command
    - If command validation succeeds, commit new events to the event store
    - Create an updated snapshot, if applicable
    - If an event dispatcher is registered, dispatch the new events

    This method also handles the optimistic concurrency mechanism that handles the case
    where two aggregates are instantiated at roughly the same time resulting in events
    with identical aggregate IDs and version numbers being committed at the same time.
    When a primary key violation is detected, this method will re-apply the command to
    the aggregate based on the new events from the competing aggregate instance.

        A `CommandResponse` containing the result of the command processing.
