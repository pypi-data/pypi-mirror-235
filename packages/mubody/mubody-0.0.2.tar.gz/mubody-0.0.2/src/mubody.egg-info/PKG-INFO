Description
===========

mubody is an astrodynamics open-source Python library focused on the
libration points and the dynamics of the multi-body regime from which
they emerge. Its aim is to be used as a tool for the design and the
analysis of space missions in the libration points. It has been
developed by students from the Technical University from Madrid (Spain).


Installation
============

Please check the [Installation Guide](https://gitlab.com/juan.b/mubody/-/wikis/Installation%20Guide) in the project [wiki](https://gitlab.com/juan.b/mubody/-/wikis).



Documentation
=============

Basic documentation can be found [here](https://mubody.readthedocs.io/) and some examples can also be found in the project [wiki](https://gitlab.com/juan.b/mubody/-/wikis).


Contributing
=============

mubody is open to contributions and collaborations. If you want to
participate as part of your Bachelor dissertation, Master's thesis, or
just as a hobby, contact us [here](mubody@proton.me)!
