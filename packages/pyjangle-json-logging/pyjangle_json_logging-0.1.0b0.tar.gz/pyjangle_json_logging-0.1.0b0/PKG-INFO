# PyJangle JSON Logging
## _Because the default logging isn't all that great_

JSON logging for use with [Pyjangle][pyjangle].  Bootstrap using [`initialize_logging`][initialize].  Don't forget to pass in a list of fields you want included in the logging output.  See the [reference implementation][reference] of PyJangle for an example.
