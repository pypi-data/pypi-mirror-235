`geolysis` is an open-source software for geotechnical engineering analysis and
modeling. `geolysis` provides soil classification based on `USCS` and `AASHTO`
standards, `bearing capacity analysis`,`estimation of soil engineering
properties`, `settlement analysis`, and `finite element modeling`. The software
assists geotechnical engineers in their day-to-day work, enabling them to
efficiently perform a wide range of tasks and make informed decisions about
design and construction. `geolysis` enhances efficiency and effectiveness,
allowing engineers to design and build better projects.
