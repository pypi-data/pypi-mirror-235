class Glue42(Component):
    """A Glue42 component.
The Glue42 initializer component. The component should be placed at the root of the application.

Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    The children of this component.

- id (optional):
    ID of this component. Used to identify Dash components in
    callbacks. The ID must be unique across all components in an app.

- fallback (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional):
    Optional. A component to display while initializing Glue42.

- glueReady (boolean; optional):
    Indicates whether Glue42 JS has initialized. The value of this
    property is assigned by the framework and must not be altered by
    client code.

- isEnterprise (boolean; optional):
    Indicates whether the app is running in Glue42 Enterprise or not.
    The value of this property is assigned by the framework and must
    not be altered by client code.

- setProps (optional):
    Dash-assigned callback that should be called to report property
    changes to Dash in order to make them available for callbacks.

- settings (dict; default {    type: CoreApplicationTypes.Client,}):
    Optional. Object containing configurations for the respective
    Glue42 libraries.

    `settings` is a dict with keys:

    - desktop (dict; optional):
        Optional. An object with one property: config. The config
        property accepts a configuration object for the
        @glue42/desktop library used in Glue42 Enterprise. You should
        define this object if your app is a Glue42 Enterprise app.

        `desktop` is a dict with keys:

        - config (dict; optional)

    - type (a value equal to: CoreApplicationTypes.Client, CoreApplicationTypes.Platform; optional):
        Optional. Accepts either \"platform\" or \"client\" as a
        value. Specifies whether this is a Main app or a Web Client in
        the context of Glue42 Core. The default is \"client\".

    - web (dict; optional):
        Optional. An object with one property: config. The config
        property accepts a configuration object for the Glue42 Web
        library. You should define this object if your app is a Web
        Client.

        `web` is a dict with keys:

        - config (dict; optional)

    - webPlatform (dict; optional):
        Optional. An object with one property: config. The config
        property accepts a configuration object for the Web Platform
        library. You should define this object if your app is a Main
        app in the context of Glue42 Core.

        `webPlatform` is a dict with keys:
