Liten API calls are 
* ask - ask any question to LitenAPI
* codegen - generate code from text
* analyze - analyze given data frame for provided text
* plot - plot a graph from given data frame
Get the docstring to know the details about the call.

Liten also provides a chat interface. This can be used within a python notebook or as a standalone application. To use it within a notebook use the following call.
```python
chatbot = Chatbot()
chatbot.start()
```

To start a standalone chatbot use the following command.
```bash
litenchat.sh -c <liten.yaml_config_file> -d <data_directory>
```
Use the server IP address provided by the chatbot to connect to it from a browser.
