"""
Ported from a Julia package, https://github.com/Winux2k/FiniteDifferenceFormula.jl,
this Python package provides a general finite difference formula generator and a
tool for teaching/learning the finite difference method. It generates finite
difference formulas for derivatives of various orders by using Taylor series
expansions of a function at evenly spaced points. It also gives the truncation
error of a formula in the big-O notation. We can use it to generate new formulas
in addition to verification of known ones. By changing decimal places, we can
also see how rounding errors may affect a result.

Beware, though formulas are mathematically correct, they may not be numerically
useful. This is true especially when we derive formulas for a derivative of higher
order. For example, run compute(9,range(-5, 6)), provided by this package, to
generate a 10-point central formula for the 9-th derivative. The formula is
mathematically correct, but it can hardly be put into use for numerical computing
without, if possible, rewriting it in a special way. Similarly, the more points
are used, the more precise a formula is mathematically. However, due to rounding
errors, this may not be true numerically.

The package exports a class, FDFormula, fd (an object of the class), and member
functions, activatepythonfunction, compute, decimalplaces, find, findbackward,
findforward, formula, formulas, taylor, taylorcoefs, tcoefs, truncationerror,
verifyformula.
