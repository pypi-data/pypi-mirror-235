# Install

`pip install InformativeFeatureSelection`

# Features

* Several implementations of feature selection algorithms based on discriminant analysis
* Binary implementation of Informative Normalized Difference Index (INDI)
* Multiclass implementation of INDI 

INDI may be extremely usefully in hyperspectral imaging analysis.

Implemented algorithms were proposed in the following papers:
