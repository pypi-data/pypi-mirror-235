Description: Bot Development is Tough.
        
        Bot Detectors like Cloudflare are ready to defend websites from our
        Bots. Configuring Selenium with ChromeOptions to specify the driver
        path, profile, user agent, and window size is Cumbersome and a nightmare
        in windows. Debugging Bot Crashes via logs is hard. How do you solve
        these pain points without sacrificing speed and handy development?
        
        Enter Botasaurus. Botasaurus is the first bot development framework in the Developer
        Community that is specifically designed to provide the best developer
        experience for bot developers. Powered by Selenium, it offers a range of
        features and functionalities to simplify the process of bot development.
        As far as our knowledge goes, Botasaurus is the first bot development
        framework of its kind in the town.
