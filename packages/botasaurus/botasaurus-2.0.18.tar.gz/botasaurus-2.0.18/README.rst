Bot Development is Tough.

Bot Detectors like Cloudflare are ready to defend websites from our
Bots. Configuring Selenium with ChromeOptions to specify the driver
path, profile, user agent, and window size is Cumbersome and a nightmare
in windows. Debugging Bot Crashes via logs is hard. How do you solve
these pain points without sacrificing speed and handy development?

Enter Botasaurus. Botasaurus is the first bot development framework in the Developer
Community that is specifically designed to provide the best developer
experience for bot developers. Powered by Selenium, it offers a range of
features and functionalities to simplify the process of bot development.

framework of its kind in the town.
