DEEPGPU-2.0 ACSpeed means DEEPGPU communication Compiler Speeding. 
This is a distributed training framework plugin for PyTorch and deepgpu nccl communication plugin for many deeplearning framworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and Caffe.
This project is to create a uniform distributed training framework plugin tool for major frameworks,
and make the distributed training as easy as possible and as fast as possible on Alibaba Cloud.
