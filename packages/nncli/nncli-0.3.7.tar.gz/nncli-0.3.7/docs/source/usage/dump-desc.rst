:program:`nncli dump` dumps notes to *stdout*. The printed format is
the text of the note preceeded by a header displaying information
about the note title, key, modified date, category, and flags. Flags
indicate whether the note has been modified locally (*X*), and/or if
it is marked as a favorite (*\**). If *search_string* is specified, it
is used to filter the notes prior to export.
