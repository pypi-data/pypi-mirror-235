Common Subcommand Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the global options, several :command:`nncli` options
apply to multiple subcommands. They are:

.. option:: --verbose, -v

  Print verbose logging information to *stdout*.

.. option:: --nosync, -n

  Operate only on the local notes cache. Do not reach out to the
  server.

.. option:: --regex, -r

  For subcommands that accept a search string, treat the search string
  as a regular expression.

.. option:: --key, -k

  The ID of the note to operate on. This option is required for many
  subcommands.
