Console GUI Usage
-----------------

.. index:: single: searching

Searching
~~~~~~~~~

nncli supports two styles of search strings. First is a Google style
search string and second is a Regular Expression.

A Google style search string is a group of tokens (separated by spaces)
with an implied *AND* between each token. This style search is case
insensitive. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   /category:category1 category:category2 word1 "word2 word3" category:category3

Regular expression searching also supports the use of flags (currently
only case-insensitive) by adding a final forward slash followed by the
flags. The following example will do a case-insensitive search for
``something``:

.. code-block:: none

   (regex) /something/i

.. index:: single: modelines

Modelines
~~~~~~~~~

Advanced text editors usually tailor their behavior based on the file
type being edited. For such editors, notes opened through nncli should
be treated as Markdown by default. However, you can change this
on a per-note basis through the use of modelines. In Vim, for instance,
a modeline is a comment line conforming to the pattern below::

   :: vim: ft=rst

Now when you edit this note Vim will automatically load the rst plugin.
