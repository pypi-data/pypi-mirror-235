# StreamlitGAuth

StreamlitGAuth is a Python library that simplifies the integration of Google Authenticator-based Single Sign-On (SSO) with Streamlit applications. With StreamlitGAuth, you can enhance the security of your Streamlit apps by enabling two-factor authentication through Google Authenticator.

## Installation

You can install StreamlitGAuth using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlitgauth
```

# Usage

```python
from google_auth.google_auth import GoogleAuth
import streamlit

client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
login = GoogleAuth(client_id, client_secret)

if login:
    print("Login successful")


```

Replace "your_client_id" and "your_client_secret" with your actual Google OAuth 2.0 credentials.

# Example Streamlit Application

```python

import streamlit as st
from google_auth.google_auth import GoogleAuth

client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"

# Authenticate with Google
login = GoogleAuth(client_id, client_secret)

if login:
    st.title("Secure Streamlit App")
    st.write("Welcome! You are logged in with Google Authenticator.")
else:
    st.error("Authentication failed. Please try again.")
```
