# Cheat at wordle!

`wordle-helper` takes a list of arguments that constrain the possibile letter placements. The
arguments take the form of \<word\>,\<constraints\>, where \<word\> is the word guessed and
\<constraints\> are the color of each letter returned by Wordle. The allowed colors are **y**ellow,
**b**lack, and **g**reen:

"y": represents yellow letters

"b": represents unused letters

"g": represents green letters

Each five letter \<word\> will have a five letter \<constraints\> string. For example:

```
~$ poetry run wordle-helper least,ybbyb
INFO:wordle-helper:Found 320 possibilites, the most common one is 'girls'
INFO:wordle-helper:Check 'words_3b035b135cec4e10aad9abd5940fff75' for all possibilites, sorted by frequency
~$ poetry run wordle-helper least,ybbyb girls,bbygg
INFO:wordle-helper:Found 2 possibilites, the most common one is 'rolls'
INFO:wordle-helper:All valid guesses, sorted by frequency:
rolls
rouls
```
