### Attribution
PhotoLibDownloader is a Python graphical user interface which hooks into the original code of
* [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://pypi.org/project/icloudpd/) V1.16.2 - a command-line tool to download photos and videos from iCloud.

which in turn uses slightly modified code from
* [pyiCloud](https://pypi.org/project/pyicloud/) - a module which allows pythonistas to interact with iCloud webservices.
