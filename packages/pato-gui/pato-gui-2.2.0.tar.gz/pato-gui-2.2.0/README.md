# pato-gui

A Python GUI for [PATO](https://github.com/paulissoft/oracle-tools) as an alternative for the Maven command line.

First you probably need to clone PATO so you use its POM files or other POM files having them as parent.

This GUI would not have been possible without [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey).

# Installation

This utility needs Python 3. You can install it using the Microsoft Store
(accessible via the Windows 10 start button) or just Google `download Python 3`.

## Start a command prompt

Please Google it if you don't know how.

## Install required Python libraries

Go to the src folder and install them from the command line using pip (or pip3 when `pip --version` displays the Python 2 version):

```
$ cd src
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

First please note that the dollar sign is the prompt sign and not a character you have to type.
Next, please do move into src first, since the root also contains a (different) `requirements.txt`.

You may need to use pip3 instead of pip if pip does not point to a Python 3 installation.

# Usage

## Launch the Python script src/pato_gui.py

This can be done directory from a command prompt or by creating a (Windows)
shortcut on your Desktop (right mouse click, choose New) or an alias on Unix/Mac OS X.

Using the command prompt:

```
$ cd src
$ python pato_gui.py
```

Please note that you may need to use python3 when `python --version` displays the Python 2 version.

## Help

In the left top corner of the GUI screen there is a Help button.
