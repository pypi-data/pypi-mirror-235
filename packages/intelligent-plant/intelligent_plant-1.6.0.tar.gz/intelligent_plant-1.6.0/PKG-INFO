# Python App Store API Client
A python implmentation of the Intelligent Plant industrial appstore API client

See the example folder for example on how to use the library for authorization code and implicit OAuth grant flows.

## Getting started

### Installing using pip

`pip install intelligent-plant`

### Installing from Source

Using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/intelligentplant/py-app-store-api`

Alternatively clone the Git repo:

`git clone https://github.com/intelligentplant/py-app-store-api.git`

## Examples

To install dependencies used by the example scripts run

`pip install -r example-requirements.txt`

To run the authorization code grant flow example run:

`python example\authorization_code_grant_flow.py`

To run the authorization code grant flow example with the PKCE extensionrun:

`python example\authorization_code_grant_flow_pkce.py`

To run the NTLM (windows authentication) example you will need to have a data core node available on the local network.
If you have an App Store Connect (https://appstore.intelligentplant.com/Home/DataSources) installed locally you can run the example without modification. If you are trying to authenticate with a data core node you will need to change the `base_url` variable defined in the script to match the URL of the Data Core admin UI

Run the example using:

`python example\ntlm_example.py`


To run the implicit grant flow example run:

*The implicit grant flow is deprecated and is disabled by default*

`python example\implicit_grant_flow.py`
