1.Introduction
===========================


This guide includes a listing of all AMPS commands as well as the
required and optional parameters. AMPS supports a consistent set of
commands and options regardless of the protocol used to communicate with
AMPS. This guide covers the semantics of the commands and options, but
does not cover how those commands and options are represented in any
particular protocol. Each protocol uses a different concrete format for
messages, and that format is specific to the protocol.

To use a command from your application, set the properties of the
Command object as shown in this guide, the use the execute function to
send the command. The AMPS client is responsible for interpreting the
command and formatting the message to AMPS in the proper format for the
specific protocol the client is using.
