    The method :meth:`on_tick` is repeatedly executed by the `:pkg:uun-iot` library. The method  gets data from uuCmd ``weatherConditions/getLast``. If it successfuly retrieved the weather data, it will attempt to display them on the strip. If there was an error (internet connection error or any other code-related Exception), go into special state and display the error on the LED strip.

    The display of error, or the actual wind speed data on the strip is exweather data, it will attempt to display them on the strip. If there was an error (internet connection error or any other code-related Exception), go into special state and display the error on the LED strip.

    The LED strip device can be realized by various physical hardwares. Examples are:

    - a simple array of one-colored LEDs controled over GPIO,
    - the same array but with a I2C controller, or
    - an individually color-controllable LED strip such as Neopixel driven by an external library.

    For each of these examples, there is a corresponding :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.devices.LedDev` driver -- called :class:`~uun_iot_libledstrip.devices.GPIODev`, :class:`~uun_iot_libledstrip.devices.I2CDev` and :class:`~uun_iot_libledstrip.devices.NeopixelDev`, respectively. All of these drivers inherit from the `LedDev` interface and are thus interchangeable. Of course, the simple one-colored LED strip cannot have different colours, but the driver behaves like they can -- this is done for interchangeability of the underlying code. The code should not depend on the current realization of the hardware LED strip backend. The LED strip type can be chosen in configuration.

    .. raw:: html

       <hr>

    The display of an error, or the actual wind speed data on the strip, is exclusive -- meaning that only the error, or the data can be displayed at the same time. For this reason, there is a :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.StripOverlayBundle` which provides exactly this exclusive access to the underlying hardware device. 

    On module initialization, two :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.LedStrip`-s are created. One responsible for the error display and the second :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStrip`, inheriting from class `LedStrip`, responsible for linear display of the wind speed on the strip. The `StripOverlayBundle` can then change in between the two by clearing the old one and activating the new one. This ensures exclusivity.

    A `LedStrip` instance is created using a `LedDev` driver and a list or a dictionary of :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.LedStripSegments`-s. Each of the segments has a fixed LED position span (for example from 2nd to 5th LED) and the segments act as basic building blocks. Each of the segments can be lit with a solid color or can blink with given color and with given period. This display action can be encapsulated in a :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.Action` object, which is a "container" for these two kinds of visualization. `Action` can be stored in a segment and then activated later, activating the saved display action (blinking/solid color).

    .. raw:: html

       <hr>

    A :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStrip` bases on `LedStrip` and is composed of :class:`uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStripSegment`-s which base on `LedStripSegment`. Each `MeterStripSegment` is given a `LedDev`, array of led IDs and two crucial values: ``value_min`` and ``value_max``. As the name `MeterStripSegment` suggests, the segment is supposed to measure some quantity. The segment linearly interpolates between tuning on no LEDs and turning on all of the allocated LEDs in the segment, based on ``value``. The ratio of turned on LEDs is computed simply as ``value/(value_max-value_min)`` and the LEDs turn on up from lowest to highest IDs (or positions). This is done by virually decreasing the number of LEDs in a segment. If the value is less than `value_min`, all LEDs are off and if above `value_max`, all LEDs are on. The ``value`` can be set using a :meth:`uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStripSegment.set_value`.

    .. raw:: html

       <hr>

    Additionaly, a `MeterStripSegment` can be initialized with an optional **hook** function. The hook function is called at the end of :meth:`uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStripSegment.set_value` and is given current `value` together with some `MeterStripSegment` properties. The function should return an Action, which will be stored into the segment and can be activated later. This can be used to dynamically change stored `Action` for the `MeterStripSegment` based on current `value` given in :meth:`~uun_iot_libledstrip.MeterStripSegment.set_value`. 

    The `MeterStrip` has a method with the same name :meth:`~MeterStripSegment.set_value` which calls `set_value` on each of its segments and additionaly activates their action.

    The following example illustrates this behaviour:

        .. code-block:: python

            def hook(value, leds, action):
                if value > 100:
                    action = Action(ActionType.SOLID, color=(255,0,0))
                else:
                    action = Action(ActionType.SOLID, color=(0,255,0))
                return leds, action

            segment = MeterStripSegment(
                device, autoshow=True, leds=[0,1,2,3,4],
                value_min=5, value_max=200,
                hook_set_value=hook
            )

            # definition of MeterStrip strip containing the segment
            strip = MeterStrip(device,[segment])

            strip.set_value(200)
            strip.set_value(50)

        >>> # the whole segment is lit red (255, 0, 0)
        >>> # some LEDs in the segment are lit green (0, 255, 0)

    This **hook** behaviour is used to set special actions if the wind speed is less than 15 knt or more than 30 knt for the first and the last segments. The whole process can be directly controlled from the configuration file.

    .. raw:: html

       <hr>

    In the **configuration file**, there are the definitions of the segments. Each segment contains a default action in keys ``color, action, interval``. The LED positions are in the ``settings`` subkey together with definitions for minimal and maximal wind values for the given segment. The segment may have defined a ``specialAction`` key. The key contains information about the associated `Action` together with a ``condition`` key. The key indicates, when to activate the special action using the **hook** `MeterStripSegment` functionality.

    Possible values of configuration ``<severity>/specialAction/condition`` are the following:

        Each `condition` translates to one of:

            - `ifWindBelow`: ``wind < windMin``,

            - `ifWindBetween`: ``windMin <= wind <= windMax``,

            - `ifWindGreater`: ``windMax < wind``,

        where `wind` is the value of wind at the time of calling :meth:`self._meter_strip.set_value`.
        If the wind conditions above are satisfied, apply the special action to the segment.
        Otherwise apply normal action.
