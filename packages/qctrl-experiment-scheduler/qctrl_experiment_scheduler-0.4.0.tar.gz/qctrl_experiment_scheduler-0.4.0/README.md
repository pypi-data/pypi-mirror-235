# Q-CTRL Experiment Scheduler

The Q-CTRL Experiment Scheduler package for Boulder Opal allows you to automate the workflow of complex calibration procedures. The scheduler will take into account the dependency between different parts of the calibration, the status of each of these parts, and the parameters that you are most interested in the calibration. With this information, it will determine the sequence that the calibrations have to be executed and run them for you.

The Q-CTRL Experiment Scheduler was developed to be used with the quantum control software toolset Boulder Opal. See how you can [get started with Boulder Opal](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/get-started) today.
