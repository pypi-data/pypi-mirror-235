# Welcome Package

Minimal TUI ready for cross-platform packaging as a pure-Python zipapp.

## Usage

1. Download `welcomepackage.pyz`
2. Run `python welcomepackage.pyz`

## Development workflow

Requires [pdm](https://pypi.org/project/pdm/) and
[pdm-packer](https://pypi.org/project/pdm-packer/).

To run from source:

```sh
pdm sync --dev
pdm run welcomepackage
```

To package for distribution:

```sh
pdm pack
# generates welcomepackage.pyz
# that's it!
```

To package as an executable with
[a portable shebang](https://realpython.com/python-shebang/#how-can-you-define-a-portable-shebang):

```sh
pdm pack --exe -i "/usr/bin/env python3"
# You can now drop this in ~/.local/bin
```
