I decided to find out\\nby making it.  \\n  \\nPartly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in\\nany field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one\\nthing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it\\'s not just\\na point labelled \"work hard.\"  \\n  \\nThe following recipe assumes you\\'re very ambitious.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nThe first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have\\nthree qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that\\nyou have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.  \\n  \\nIn practice you don\\'t have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious\\npeople are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to\\ndo is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. [1]  \\n  \\nThat sounds straightforward, but it\\'s often quite difficult. When you\\'re young\\nyou don\\'t know what you\\'re good at or what different kinds of work are like.\\nSome kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some\\npeople know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.  \\n  \\nThe way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you\\'re not sure what\\nto work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You\\'ll probably guess\\nwrong some of the time, but that\\'s fine. It\\'s good to know about multiple\\nthings; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between\\ndifferent fields.  \\n  \\nDevelop a habit of working on your own projects. Don\\'t let \"work\" mean\\nsomething other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one\\nday, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some\\nbigger project, but you\\'ll be driving your part of it.  \\n  \\nWhat should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As\\nyou grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will\\nconverge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of\\nLego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you\\'re starting to\\nexplore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s a kind of excited curiosity that\\'s both the engine and the rudder of\\ngreat work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will\\nalso show you what to work on.  \\n  \\nWhat are you excessively curious about -- curious to a degree that would bore\\nmost other people? That\\'s what you\\'re looking for.  \\n  \\nOnce you\\'ve found something you\\'re excessively interested in, the next step is\\nto learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge.\\nKnowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but\\nonce you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.  \\n  \\nThe next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain\\nwants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many\\ndiscoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else\\ntook for granted. [2]  \\n  \\nIf the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a\\ntincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be\\naffected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.  \\n  \\nBoldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren\\'t interested in them --\\nin fact, especially if they aren\\'t. If you\\'re excited about some possibility\\nthat everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely\\nwhat they\\'re all overlooking, that\\'s as good a bet as you\\'ll find. [3]  \\n  \\nFour steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps,\\nexplore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who\\'s done great work\\nhas done it, from painters to physicists.  \\n  \\nSteps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove\\nthat you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is\\non the scale of the evidence for mortality. That\\'s why it\\'s essential to work\\non something you\\'re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work\\nharder than mere diligence ever could.  \\n  \\nThe three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do\\nsomething impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the\\nmost powerful of all.  \\n  \\nThe big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the\\nsurface of knowledge, pry it open, and there\\'s a whole world inside.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nLet\\'s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what\\nto work on. The main reason it\\'s hard is that you can\\'t tell what most kinds\\nof work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you\\nmay have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it\\nor how good you are at it. And in the meantime you\\'re not doing, and thus not\\nlearning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late\\nbased on very incomplete information. [4]  \\n  \\nThe nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms,\\none that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most\\npeople who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the\\nharder it will be to decide what to do.  \\n  \\nThe educational systems in most countries pretend it\\'s easy. They expect you\\nto commit to a field long before you could know what it\\'s really like. And as\\na result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the\\nsystem as an instance of breakage.  \\n  \\nIt would be better if they at least admitted it -- if they admitted that the\\nsystem not only can\\'t do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is\\ndesigned on the assumption that you\\'ll somehow magically guess as a teenager.\\nThey don\\'t tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work\\non, you\\'re on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the\\nrest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the\\nassumption that everyone does.  \\n  \\nWhat should you do if you\\'re young and ambitious but don\\'t know what to work\\non? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will\\nsolve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure\\nyou can follow. When you read biographies of people who\\'ve done great work,\\nit\\'s remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a\\nresult of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So\\nyou need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to\\nbe curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask\\nlots of questions. [5]  \\n  \\nWhen in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more\\nabout them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what\\nyou do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of\\nwork a chance to show you what they\\'re like. But a field should become\\n_increasingly_ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn\\'t, it\\'s\\nprobably not for you.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t worry if you find you\\'re interested in different things than other\\npeople. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange\\ntastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you\\'ll be\\nproductive. And you\\'re more likely to find new things if you\\'re looking where\\nfew have looked before.  \\n  \\nOne sign that you\\'re suited for some kind of work is when you like even the\\nparts that other people find tedious or frightening.  \\n  \\nBut fields aren\\'t people; you don\\'t owe them any loyalty. If in the course of\\nworking on one thing you discover another that\\'s more exciting, don\\'t be\\nafraid to switch.  \\n  \\nIf you\\'re making something for people, make sure it\\'s something they actually\\nwant. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write\\nthe story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends\\nprobably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.  \\n  \\nThis _should_ follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting\\nstory to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this\\ncase explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what\\nthey want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience\\nwants. And once you go down that route, you\\'re lost. [6]  \\n  \\nThere are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you\\'re trying to\\nfigure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics,\\nother people\\'s wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find\\ngenuinely interesting, you\\'ll be proof against all of them. If you\\'re\\ninterested, you\\'re not astray.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nFollowing your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in\\npractice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You\\nusually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of\\nboldness.  \\n  \\nBut while you need boldness, you don\\'t usually need much planning. In most\\ncases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly\\nambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a\\nplan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.  \\n  \\nThe trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can\\ndescribe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a\\nchild and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can\\'t discover natural\\nselection that way.  \\n  \\nI think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not\\nto plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives\\nyou the best options for the future. I call this approach \"staying upwind.\"\\nThis is how most people who\\'ve done great work seem to have done it.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nEven when you\\'ve found something exciting to work on, working on it is not\\nalways straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap\\nout of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be\\nplenty of times when things aren\\'t like that.  \\n  \\nYou don\\'t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There\\nare headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there\\'s a technique to\\nworking, just as there is to sailing.  \\n  \\nFor example, while you must work hard, it\\'s possible to work too hard, and if\\nyou do that you\\'ll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you\\nstupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields\\ndiminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might\\nonly be able to do for four or five hours a day.  \\n  \\nIdeally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange\\nyour life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You\\'ll shy away from hard\\ntasks if you know you might be interrupted.  \\n  \\nIt will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You\\'ll often\\nhave to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don\\'t worry about\\nthis; it\\'s the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort\\nof activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold\\nis fake in the sense that it\\'s higher than the energy required to keep going,\\nit\\'s ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but\\nthis is one of the rare cases where it isn\\'t. When I\\'m reluctant to start work\\nin the morning, I often trick myself by saying \"I\\'ll just read over what I\\'ve\\ngot so far.\" Five minutes later I\\'ve found something that seems mistaken or\\nincomplete, and I\\'m off.  \\n  \\nSimilar techniques work for starting new projects. It\\'s ok to lie to yourself\\nabout how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things\\nbegan with someone saying \"How hard could it be?\"  \\n  \\nThis is one case where the young have an advantage. They\\'re more optimistic,\\nand even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this\\ncase ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.  \\n  \\nTry to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work\\nthan you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or\\nself-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was\\nmeant to be the final stage.  \\n  \\nAnother permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you\\'re working\\non, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it\\nmay turn out not to have been a lie after all. [7]  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nSince there are two senses of starting work -- per day and per project --\\nthere are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is\\nfar the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year\\nto year because the time isn\\'t quite right. When you\\'re procrastinating in\\nunits of years, you can get a lot not done. [8]  \\n  \\nOne reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually\\ncamouflages itself as work. You\\'re not just sitting around doing nothing;\\nyou\\'re working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination\\ndoesn\\'t set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You\\'re too busy\\nto notice it.  \\n  \\nThe way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on\\nwhat I most want to work on? When you\\'re young it\\'s ok if the answer is\\nsometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older. [9]  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an\\nunreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can\\'t think of this time as a\\ncost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently\\nengaging as it\\'s happening.  \\n  \\nThere may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things\\nyou hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work\\nhappens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you\\'re\\ngenuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you\\'re surprised how\\nfar you\\'ve come.  \\n  \\nThe reason we\\'re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of\\nwork. Writing a page a day doesn\\'t sound like much, but if you do it every day\\nyou\\'ll write a book a year. That\\'s the key: consistency. People who do great\\nthings don\\'t get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than\\nnothing.  \\n  \\nIf you do work that compounds, you\\'ll get exponential growth. Most people who\\ndo this do it unconsciously, but it\\'s worth stopping to think about. Learning,\\nfor example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about\\nsomething, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the\\nmore fans you have, the more new fans they\\'ll bring you.  \\n  \\nThe trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the\\nbeginning. It isn\\'t; it\\'s still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can\\'t\\ngrasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early\\nstages.  \\n  \\nSomething that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it\\'s worth\\nmaking an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate\\nexponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people\\npush through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because\\nthey know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial\\npush, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing\\nbetter to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential\\ngrowth, many more would do it.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nWork doesn\\'t just happen when you\\'re trying to. There\\'s a kind of undirected\\nthinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be\\nvery powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you\\'ll often solve\\nproblems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.  \\n  \\nYou have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon,\\nthough. You can\\'t just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be\\ninterleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions. [10]  \\n  \\nEveryone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it\\'s also important to avoid\\nthem in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders\\nto whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of\\ndistraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you\\'ll waste this\\nvaluable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don\\'t avoid\\nlove.)  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nConsciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you\\nknow which is the best and what makes it so, you don\\'t know what you\\'re aiming\\nfor.  \\n  \\nAnd that _is_ what you\\'re aiming for, because if you don\\'t try to be the best,\\nyou won\\'t even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so\\nmany different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it\\'s true. It\\ncould be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one\\ndirection -- where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling\\nshort. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively\\ndifferent thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too\\nvague a standard. Probably all three are true. [11]  \\n  \\nFortunately there\\'s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like\\nyou\\'d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you\\noften end up net ahead. It\\'s exciting, and also strangely liberating. It\\nsimplifies things. In some ways it\\'s easier to try to be the best than to try\\nmerely to be good.  \\n  \\nOne way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in\\na hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your\\ncontemporaries\\', but because something that still seems good in a hundred\\nyears is more likely to be genuinely good.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nDon\\'t try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can;\\nyou won\\'t be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.  \\n  \\nStyle is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is\\naffectation.  \\n  \\nAffectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the\\nwork. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you\\'re pleased with\\nthe impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work. [12]  \\n  \\nThe temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel\\nlike nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it\\'s\\nself-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at\\nan ambitious project, you\\'re not a nobody; you\\'re the person who did it. So\\njust do the work and your identity will take care of itself.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you\\nexpress this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what\\nnot to be? The best answer is earnest. If you\\'re earnest you avoid not just\\naffectation but a whole set of similar vices.  \\n  \\nThe core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We\\'re taught as\\nchildren to be honest as an unselfish virtue -- as a kind of sacrifice. But in\\nfact it\\'s a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally\\nsharp eye for the truth. You\\'re trying to see more truth than others have seen\\nso far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you\\'re\\nintellectually dishonest?  \\n  \\nOne way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive\\npressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that\\nyou\\'re mistaken. Once you\\'ve admitted you were mistaken about something,\\nyou\\'re free. Till then you have to carry it. [13]  \\n  \\nAnother more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is\\nmuch more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It\\'s not\\nmerely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of\\nwhat doesn\\'t.  \\n  \\nWhat formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the\\nwork, you\\'re trying to seem a certain way as you\\'re doing it. But any energy\\nthat goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That\\'s one reason nerds\\nhave an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming\\nanything. In fact that\\'s basically the definition of a nerd.  \\n  \\nNerds have a kind of innocent boldness that\\'s exactly what you need in doing\\ngreat work. It\\'s not learned; it\\'s preserved from childhood. So hold onto it.\\nBe the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and\\noffers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. \"It\\'s easy to criticize\" is\\ntrue in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.  \\n  \\nThere may be some jobs where it\\'s an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic,\\nbut if you want to do great work it\\'s an advantage to be optimistic, even\\nthough that means you\\'ll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There\\'s an old\\ntradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it\\'s better to keep\\nquiet lest you look like a fool. But that\\'s advice for _seeming_ smart. If you\\nactually want to discover new things, it\\'s better to take the risk of telling\\npeople your ideas.  \\n  \\nSome people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious\\neffort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be\\npossible to do great work without being earnest. It\\'s so hard to do even if\\nyou are. You don\\'t have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions\\nintroduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable,\\nor cool. [14]  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nGreat work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It\\'s\\nusually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on\\nsomething, ask which choice is more consistent.  \\n  \\nYou may have to throw things away and redo them. You won\\'t necessarily have\\nto, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there\\'s\\nsomething you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep\\nyou in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I\\'d already made the change,\\nwould I want to revert to what I have now?  \\n  \\nHave the confidence to cut. Don\\'t keep something that doesn\\'t fit just because\\nyou\\'re proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.  \\n  \\nIndeed, in some kinds of work it\\'s good to strip whatever you\\'re doing to its\\nessence. The result will be more concentrated; you\\'ll understand it better;\\nand you won\\'t be able to lie to yourself about whether there\\'s anything real\\nthere.  \\n  \\nMathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts.\\nThat\\'s what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\" applied to a\\nproof. But now I suspect it\\'s conceptually prior -- that the main ingredient\\nin artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it\\'s a useful\\nstandard well beyond math.  \\n  \\nElegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have\\nmore prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they\\'re hard to\\nunderstand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.  \\n  \\nWhereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little\\neffort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn\\'t have to be built,\\njust seen. It\\'s a very good sign when it\\'s hard to say whether you\\'re creating\\nsomething or discovering it.  \\n  \\nWhen you\\'re doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err\\non the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through\\nwhich the ideas take their natural shape.  \\n  \\n(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work\\non. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case it\\'s more like\\ncreating something. In the best case you create the field in the process of\\nexploring it.)  \\n  \\nSimilarly, if you\\'re trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously\\nunrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you\\ndidn\\'t expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you\\ndon\\'t know what the benefit will be.  \\n  \\nGreat work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others\\nbuild on. So it\\'s a good sign if you\\'re creating ideas that others could use,\\nor exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have\\nimplications in many different areas.  \\n  \\nIf you express your ideas in the most general form, they\\'ll be truer than you\\nintended.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nTrue by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be true and new.\\nAnd it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you\\'ve\\nlearned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.  \\n  \\nIn English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and\\nimagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it\\ndoes seem to some extent a separate skill. It\\'s possible to have a great deal\\nof ability in other respects -- to have a great deal of what\\'s often called\\n\"technical ability\" -- and yet not have much of this.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading. Originality\\nisn\\'t a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas\\nabout whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They\\ncan\\'t help it.  \\n  \\nIf the thing they\\'re focused on is something they don\\'t understand very well,\\nthese new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know\\ndecided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much\\nabout dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly\\ncolorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its\\nnature all the more clear.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s possible to cultivate originality, but there are\\ndefinitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you\\'re\\nmuch more likely to have original ideas when you\\'re working on something.\\nOriginal ideas don\\'t come from trying to have original ideas. They come from\\ntrying to build or understand something slightly too difficult. [15]  \\n  \\nTalking or writing about the things you\\'re interested in is a good way to\\ngenerate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea\\ncreates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there\\'s a kind of\\nthinking that can only be done by writing.  \\n  \\nChanging your context can help. If you visit a new place, you\\'ll often find\\nyou have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may\\nnot have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it\\'s enough just to go for a\\nwalk. [16]  \\n  \\nIt also helps to travel in topic space. You\\'ll have more new ideas if you\\nexplore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder\\nmore surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially\\nfruitful source of new ideas.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t divide your attention _evenly_ between many topics though, or you\\'ll\\nspread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something\\nmore like a power law. [17] Be professionally curious about a few topics and\\nidly curious about many more.  \\n  \\nCuriosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by\\ngiving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that.\\nCuriosity is itself a kind of originality; it\\'s roughly to questions what\\noriginality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big\\ncomponent of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nHaving new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing\\nthings that were right under your nose. Once you\\'ve seen a new idea, it tends\\nto seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?  \\n  \\nWhen an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it\\'s probably a good one.  \\n  \\nSeeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is\\nhard. What\\'s the source of this apparent contradiction? It\\'s that seeing the\\nnew idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see\\nthe world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a\\nbroken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model\\nis hard. That\\'s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:\\nthey\\'re easy to see after you do something hard.  \\n  \\nOne way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken\\nmodels of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality.\\nMost people don\\'t want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to\\nsay that they\\'re attached to their current model; it\\'s what they think in; so\\nthey\\'ll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however\\nconspicuous it may seem in retrospect.  \\n  \\nTo find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking\\naway. That\\'s what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of\\nMaxwell\\'s equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as\\nbecause he was stricter.  \\n  \\nThe other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it\\nsounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of\\nperson who\\'s comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old\\nmodel, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually\\nbreaks at least implicit rules.  \\n  \\nFew understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem\\nmuch more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once\\nyou\\'re using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they\\ndidn\\'t at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric\\nmodel to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so\\nwrong.  \\n  \\nIndeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people,\\nor someone would have already explored it. So what you\\'re looking for is ideas\\nthat seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You\\ncan\\'t with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are\\nthe right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they\\'re rich in implications;\\nwhereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.  \\n  \\nThere are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them,\\nand to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and\\npassively independent-minded.  \\n  \\nThe aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don\\'t merely\\nfail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort\\nof person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies\\nenough activation energy to get it started.  \\n  \\nThe other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to\\nknow they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries;\\ntheir ignorance of a field\\'s assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive\\nindependent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to\\nconventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new\\nideas.  \\n  \\nStrictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular\\nculture they\\'re opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this\\nrespect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial\\nmatters strictness and rule-breaking _are_ opposed. But in questions that\\nreally matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nAn overlooked idea often doesn\\'t lose till the semifinals. You do see it,\\nsubconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down\\nbecause it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial.\\nThis suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you\\ncould see more new ideas.  \\n  \\nOne way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for _someone else_ to\\nexplore. Then your subconscious won\\'t shoot them down to protect you.  \\n  \\nYou could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by\\nstarting from what\\'s obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is\\nsurrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they\\ncontradict it.  \\n  \\nReligions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything\\nthat can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will\\nhave valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made\\ndiscoveries of this type. [18]  \\n  \\nWhat are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too\\nattached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think?\\nWhat becomes possible if you discard it?  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nPeople show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which\\nproblems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when\\ndeciding what to work on. People who\\'d never dream of being fashionable in any\\nother way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.  \\n  \\nOne reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions\\nis that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while\\nexploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are\\ntoo conservative. They\\'re not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as\\nwell. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.  \\n  \\nOne of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that\\npeople think has been fully explored, but hasn\\'t. Great work often takes\\nsomething that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt\\nboth did this. So if you\\'re interested in a field that others think is tapped\\nout, don\\'t let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.  \\n  \\nWorking on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There\\'s no hype or\\nhurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work\\noften has an old-school solidity. And there\\'s a satisfying sense of economy in\\ncultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.  \\n  \\nBut the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable\\nin the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn\\'t seem to matter as much\\nas it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent -- by\\nletting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the\\nlittle voice in your head that says you should only be working on \"important\"\\nproblems.  \\n  \\nYou do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too\\nconservative about what counts as one. And if there\\'s an important but\\noverlooked problem in your neighborhood, it\\'s probably already on your\\nsubconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a\\nbreak from \"serious\" work to work on something just because it would be really\\ninteresting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it\\nseems.  \\n  \\nOriginality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in\\nsolving them. That\\'s what distinguishes the people who discover whole new\\nfields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step -- deciding what to\\nwork on -- is in a sense the key to the whole game.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nFew grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the\\nratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are\\nanswers, but often the real insight was in the question.  \\n  \\nPart of the reason we underrate questions is the way they\\'re used in schools.\\nIn schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like\\nunstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A\\nreally good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the\\nforce that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets\\nin their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly\\nnovel territory.  \\n  \\nUnanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But\\nthe more you\\'re carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution -- or\\nperhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the\\nsame.  \\n  \\nSometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from\\nreturning to a question you first noticed years before -- in your childhood,\\neven -- and couldn\\'t stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the\\nimportance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it\\'s just as important\\nto keep your youthful questions alive. [19]  \\n  \\nThis is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular\\npicture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the\\nmore puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you\\'re puzzled\\nabout matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.  \\n  \\nThink about what\\'s happening at the moment just before a new idea is\\ndiscovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about\\nsomething. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement -- of\\nconfusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of\\npuzzles that you\\'re willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don\\'t\\nwant to solve them. [20]  \\n  \\nIt\\'s a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of\\nthose situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire\\nnew questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don\\'t just lead to\\nanswers, but also to more questions.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nThe best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from\\nthe current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and\\nlonger. So don\\'t require a question to be obviously big before you try\\nanswering it. You can rarely predict that. It\\'s hard enough even to notice the\\nthread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s better to be promiscuously curious -- to pull a little bit on a lot of\\nthreads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of\\nbig things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then\\ngrew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.  \\n  \\nBeing prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater\\nthe chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots\\nof things will mean trying lots of things that don\\'t work. You can\\'t have a\\nlot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones. [21]  \\n  \\nThough it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that\\'s been\\ndone before, you\\'ll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you\\'ll\\nunderstand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of\\nstarting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas\\nfit together like two puzzle pieces.  \\n  \\nHow do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making\\nsuccessive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive\\nversions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version\\nis both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s particularly useful to make successive versions when you\\'re making\\nsomething for people -- to get an initial version in front of them quickly,\\nand then evolve it based on their response.  \\n  \\nBegin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly\\noften, it does. If it doesn\\'t, this will at least get you started.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for\\ndoing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second\\n(the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more\\ngeneral principle.  \\n  \\nAn early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It\\'s a\\ngood sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs\\nexcept scale, and that tends to follow. [22]  \\n  \\nThe alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in\\nadvance what you\\'re going to do. And planning does usually seem the more\\nresponsible choice. It sounds more organized to say \"we\\'re going to do x and\\nthen y and then z\" than \"we\\'re going to try x and see what happens.\" And it is\\nmore _organized_ ; it just doesn\\'t work as well.  \\n  \\nPlanning per se isn\\'t good. It\\'s sometimes necessary, but it\\'s a necessary\\nevil -- a response to unforgiving conditions. It\\'s something you have to do\\nbecause you\\'re working with inflexible media, or because you need to\\ncoordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use\\nflexible media, you don\\'t have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve\\ninstead.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nTake as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is\\nproportionate to reward, so don\\'t look for certainty, but for a bet with high\\nexpected value. If you\\'re not failing occasionally, you\\'re probably being too\\nconservative.  \\n  \\nThough conservatism is usually associated with the old, it\\'s the young who\\ntend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it\\'s when\\nyou\\'re young that you can afford the most.  \\n  \\nEven a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it,\\nyou\\'ll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions\\nfew others have asked. And there\\'s probably no better source of questions than\\nthe ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nUse the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once\\nyou have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and\\nfreedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power.\\nWith effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the\\nformer when old.  \\n  \\nThe old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The\\nyoung often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The\\nyoung have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time\\nto advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something\\nyou don\\'t need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building\\nsomething just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at\\nsomething.  \\n  \\nThat \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you\\'re\\nyoung, but don\\'t simply waste it. There\\'s a big difference between doing\\nsomething you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for\\nsure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you\\nthink. [23]  \\n  \\nThe most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that\\nyou\\'re seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for\\nthe first time, sometimes the two don\\'t fit together perfectly. Usually the\\nproblem is with your brain, but occasionally it\\'s with the idea. A piece of it\\nsticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used\\nto the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to.\\n[24]  \\n  \\nSo when you\\'re learning about something for the first time, pay attention to\\nthings that seem wrong or missing. You\\'ll be tempted to ignore them, since\\nthere\\'s a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside\\nyour misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don\\'t forget about them.\\nWhen you\\'ve gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they\\'re\\nstill there. If they\\'re still viable in the light of your present knowledge,\\nthey probably represent an undiscovered idea.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nOne of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know\\nwhat you _don\\'t_ have to worry about. The young know all the things that could\\nmatter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about\\neverything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at\\nall about the rest.  \\n  \\nBut what you don\\'t know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other\\nhalf is what you do know that ain\\'t so. You arrive at adulthood with your head\\nfull of nonsense -- bad habits you\\'ve acquired and false things you\\'ve been\\ntaught -- and you won\\'t be able to do great work till you clear away at least\\nthe nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.  \\n  \\nMuch of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We\\'re so used\\nto schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with\\nlearning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp\\nour ideas about learning and thinking.  \\n  \\nFor example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was\\nan authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to\\nlearn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are\\nintrinsic to learning; they\\'re just artifacts of the way schools are usually\\ndesigned.  \\n  \\nThe sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you\\'re still in school,\\ntry thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working\\nfor you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it\\'s not merely\\nsome weird thought experiment. It\\'s the truth, economically, and in the best\\ncase it\\'s the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don\\'t want to be\\nyour bosses. They\\'d prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of\\nadvice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.  \\n  \\nSchools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school\\nthey tell you what the problems are, and they\\'re almost always soluble using\\nno more than you\\'ve been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out\\nwhat the problems are, and you often don\\'t know if they\\'re soluble at all.  \\n  \\nBut perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking\\nthe test. You can\\'t do great work by doing that. You can\\'t trick God. So stop\\nlooking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on\\nproblems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work\\nitself.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nDon\\'t think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a \"big\\nbreak.\" Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on\\ndoing good work rather than chasing influential people.  \\n  \\nAnd don\\'t take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress\\nadmissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those\\nrequired to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only\\nmeaningful to the extent that they\\'re part of a feedback loop, and very few\\nare.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nPeople new to a field will often copy existing work. There\\'s nothing\\ninherently bad about that. There\\'s no better way to learn how something works\\nthan by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work\\nunoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old\\nones.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you\\'re going to copy something,\\ndo it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is\\nwhat\\'s meant by the famously misattributed phrase \"Great artists steal.\" The\\nreally dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is\\nthe kind that\\'s done without realizing it, because you\\'re nothing more than a\\ntrain running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme,\\ncopying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination. [25]  \\n  \\nIn many fields it\\'s almost inevitable that your early work will be in some\\nsense based on other people\\'s. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They\\'re\\nusually a reaction to previous work. When you\\'re first starting out, you don\\'t\\nhave any previous work; if you\\'re going to react to something, it has to be\\nsomeone else\\'s. Once you\\'re established, you can react to your own. But while\\nthe former gets called derivative and the latter doesn\\'t, structurally the two\\ncases are more similar than they seem.  \\n  \\nOddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them\\nseem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have\\nto be conceived initially as variations of existing things, _even by their\\ndiscoverers_ , because there isn\\'t yet the conceptual vocabulary to express\\nthem.  \\n  \\nThere are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you\\'ll tend\\nto copy old things -- things that were in their day at the frontier of\\nknowledge, but no longer are.  \\n  \\nAnd when you do copy something, don\\'t copy every feature of it. Some will make\\nyou ridiculous if you do. Don\\'t copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old\\nprofessor if you\\'re 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem\\nhundreds of years later.  \\n  \\nSome of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite.\\nIndeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the\\nflaws.  \\n  \\nThis is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and\\nthis sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of\\nbeing talented. It isn\\'t; being talented is merely how they get away with it.  \\n  \\nOne of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field\\ninto another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it\\'s\\nprobably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds\\nof work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be\\nmetaphors.  \\n  \\nNegative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can\\nsometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well;\\nsometimes it only becomes clear what\\'s needed when it\\'s missing.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nIf a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it\\'s\\nusually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and\\nalso, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-\\nconfidence. [26]  \\n  \\nIf you\\'re earnest you\\'ll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect.\\nMost people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with\\nanyone who\\'s genuinely interested. If they\\'re really good at their work, then\\nthey probably have a hobbyist\\'s interest in it, and hobbyists always want to\\ntalk about their hobbies.  \\n  \\nIt may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing\\ngreat work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities,\\nthere\\'s a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from\\ntrue. People within universities can\\'t say so openly, but the quality of the\\nwork being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments\\nhave people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nSeek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can\\'t be done\\nalone, and even if you\\'re working on one that can be, it\\'s good to have other\\npeople to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.  \\n  \\nColleagues don\\'t just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work\\nwith people you want to become like, because you will.  \\n  \\nQuality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It\\'s better to have one\\nor two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it\\'s not\\nmerely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great\\nwork happens in clusters suggests that one\\'s colleagues often make the\\ndifference between doing great work and not.  \\n  \\nHow do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience,\\nwhen you do, you know. Which means if you\\'re unsure, you probably don\\'t. But\\nit may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here\\'s an\\nattempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer _surprising_ insights. They can\\nsee and do things that you can\\'t. So if you have a handful of colleagues good\\nenough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you\\'re probably over the\\nthreshold.  \\n  \\nMost of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects\\nrequire people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for\\neveryone. If you want to run a project like that, you\\'ll have to become a\\nmanager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of\\nwork. If you don\\'t have them, there is no middle path: you must either force\\nyourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects.\\n[27]  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nHusband your morale. It\\'s the basis of everything when you\\'re working on\\nambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.  \\n  \\nMorale starts with your view of life. You\\'re more likely to do great work if\\nyou\\'re an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than\\nif you think of yourself as a victim.  \\n  \\nIndeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose\\nwork that\\'s pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the\\ndifficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it\\'s a very productive\\nform of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in\\nhistory.  \\n  \\nMorale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases\\nyour morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in\\nthe other direction: if you\\'re not doing good work, that can demoralize you\\nand make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be\\nrunning in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work\\nwhen you\\'re stuck, just so you start to get something done.  \\n  \\nOne of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to\\ndestroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate\\nyourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your\\nprocess. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.  \\n  \\nDoing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So\\n\"If at first you don\\'t succeed, try, try again\" isn\\'t quite right. It should\\nbe: If at first you don\\'t succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try\\nagain.  \\n  \\n\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it\\'s\\nthe right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks\\npanic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon\\nthe root node.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it\\'s a\\nbad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you\\'re\\nrunning. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of\\neffort; bad pain is a sign of damage.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nAn audience is a critical component of morale. If you\\'re a scholar, your\\naudience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the\\ntraditional sense. Either way it doesn\\'t need to be big. The value of an\\naudience doesn\\'t grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news\\nif you\\'re famous, but good news if you\\'re just starting out, because it means\\na small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of\\npeople genuinely love what you\\'re doing, that\\'s enough.  \\n  \\nTo the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your\\naudience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it\\'s so liberating to\\nescape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that\\nwill let you go direct. [28]  \\n  \\nThe people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale.\\nYou\\'ll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease\\nit, and the effect someone has is not always what you\\'d expect. Seek out the\\npeople who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of\\ncourse if there\\'s someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t marry someone who doesn\\'t understand that you need to work, or sees your\\nwork as competition for your attention. If you\\'re ambitious, you need to work;\\nit\\'s almost like a medical condition; so someone who won\\'t let you work either\\ndoesn\\'t understand you, or does and doesn\\'t care.  \\n  \\nUltimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it\\'s important to\\ntake care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well,\\nand avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are\\nparticularly good forms of exercise because they\\'re good for thinking. [29]  \\n  \\nPeople who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but\\nthey\\'re happier than they\\'d be if they didn\\'t. In fact, if you\\'re smart and\\nambitious, it\\'s dangerous _not_ to be productive. People who are smart and\\nambitious but don\\'t achieve much tend to become bitter.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nIt\\'s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The\\nopinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much\\nlarger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.  \\n  \\nThe prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes\\ncompletely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you\\'ll make it\\nprestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much\\nprestige it has, but how well it could be done.  \\n  \\nCompetition can be an effective motivator, but don\\'t let it choose the problem\\nfor you; don\\'t let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because\\nothers are. In fact, don\\'t let competitors make you do anything much more\\nspecific than work harder.  \\n  \\nCuriosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than\\nyou do about what\\'s worth paying attention to.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nNotice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to\\ndoing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on\\n\"curiosity.\"  \\n  \\nThat doesn\\'t translate directly to advice. It\\'s not enough just to be curious,\\nand you can\\'t command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it\\ndrive you.  \\n  \\nCuriosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the\\nfield for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it,\\nand drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with\\ncuriosity.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nBelieve it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its\\nlength at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must\\nbe interested in doing great work. And if so you\\'re already further along than\\nyou might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.  \\n  \\nThe factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical\\nsense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition\\nyou can\\'t do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort,\\nif you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability\\nand interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will\\ncombine to yield an explosion of new ideas?  \\n  \\nHere there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do\\ngreat work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those\\ndifferent types of work, the one you\\'re most suited for is probably a pretty\\nclose match. Probably a comically close match. It\\'s just a question of finding\\nit, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can\\nonly answer that by trying.  \\n  \\nMany more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a\\ncombination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or\\nShakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that,\\nyou\\'d fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people\\nconsciously decide not to try to do great work. But that\\'s what\\'s going on\\nsubconsciously; they shy away from the question.  \\n  \\nSo I\\'m going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or\\nnot? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn\\'t have\\ndone it to a general audience. But we already know you\\'re interested.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t worry about being presumptuous. You don\\'t have to tell anyone. And if\\nit\\'s too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than\\nthat. In fact you\\'ll be lucky if it\\'s the worst problem you have.  \\n  \\nYes, you\\'ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard.\\nAnd if you\\'re working on something you find very interesting, which you\\nnecessarily will if you\\'re on the right path, the work will probably feel less\\nburdensome than a lot of your peers\\'.  \\n  \\nThe discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n**Notes**  \\n  \\n[1] I don\\'t think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great\\nwork. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand\\npeople\\'s ideas of what\\'s possible. But there\\'s no threshold for importance.\\nIt\\'s a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I\\'d\\nrather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about\\nwhether they\\'re important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave\\nit to future generations to say if you succeeded.  \\n  \\n[2] A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life.\\n\"Did you ever notice...?\" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial\\nthings. Which may help explain why people\\'s reaction to a new idea is often\\nthe first half of laughing: Ha!  \\n  \\n[3] That second qualifier is critical. If you\\'re excited about something most\\nauthorities discount, but you can\\'t give a more precise explanation than \"they\\ndon\\'t get it,\" then you\\'re starting to drift into the territory of cranks.  \\n  \\n[4] Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match\\nbetween the current version of you and a list of known problems. You\\'ll often\\nhave to coevolve with the problem. That\\'s why it can sometimes be so hard to\\nfigure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It\\'s the cartesian\\nproduct of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered,\\nand all possible future versions of you.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on\\nheuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches\\nwill be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have\\nbeen collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic\\nsimilarities between them.  \\n  \\n[5] There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work,\\nbut one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they\\'re more likely\\nto find the right thing to work on in the first place.  \\n  \\n[6] It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less\\nsophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make\\na lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but\\nit\\'s not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.  \\n  \\n[7] This idea I learned from Hardy\\'s _A Mathematician\\'s Apology_ , which I\\nrecommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.  \\n  \\n[8] Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we\\ncan do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating\\nfor a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several\\nyears.  \\n  \\n[9] You can\\'t usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially\\nearly on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you\\nwant and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely\\nand do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks:\\nin the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second\\nyou have to fight to get time to do it.  \\n  \\n[10] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle\\nautomatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to\\nand from.  \\n  \\n[11] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without\\nconsciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it\\nbecomes: Don\\'t try to be anything except the best.  \\n  \\n[12] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to\\nadopt a fake persona. But even here it\\'s possible to be affected. Perhaps the\\nrule in such fields should be to avoid _unintentional_ affectation.  \\n  \\n[13] It\\'s safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if\\nthey\\'re also unfalsifiable. For example, it\\'s safe to have the principle that\\neveryone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a\\n\"should\" in it isn\\'t really a statement about the world and is therefore hard\\nto disprove. And if there\\'s no evidence that could disprove one of your\\nprinciples, there can\\'t be any facts you\\'d need to ignore in order to preserve\\nit.  \\n  \\n[14] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation\\nis often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual\\ndishonesty is more of a character flaw.  \\n  \\n[15] Obviously you don\\'t have to be working at the exact moment you have the\\nidea, but you\\'ll probably have been working fairly recently.  \\n  \\n[16] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I\\'m skeptical, but\\nalso almost totally ignorant of their effects.  \\n  \\n[17] For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your\\nattention, for some m > 1. You couldn\\'t allocate your attention so precisely,\\nof course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.  \\n  \\n[18] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone\\nmight adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of\\nthe religion from everyone else.  \\n  \\n[19] It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you\\nwondered about in your youth. You might find you\\'re now in a position to do\\nsomething about some of them.  \\n  \\n[20] The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange\\nphenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the\\nindependent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even\\nthough they\\'re generally stupider.\\n\\n> The best lack all conviction, while the worst  \\n>  Are full of passionate intensity.\\n\\n[21] Derived from Linus Pauling\\'s \"If you want to have good ideas, you must\\nhave many ideas.\"  \\n  \\n[22] Attacking a project as a \"toy\" is similar to attacking a statement as\\n\"inappropriate.\" It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to\\nstick.  \\n  \\n[23] One way to tell whether you\\'re wasting time is to ask if you\\'re producing\\nor consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than\\nplaying them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to\\nbe a waste of time than playing games where you don\\'t.  \\n  \\n[24] Another related advantage is that if you haven\\'t said anything publicly\\nyet, you won\\'t be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier\\nconclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this\\nrespect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published\\nopinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.  \\n  \\n[25] In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria\\nhanding a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted his own version to\\nshow how much better he was.  \\n  \\n[26] I\\'m being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of this writing,\\nbeing in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate,\\nbut that could change.  \\n  \\n[27] This is false when the work the other people have to do is very\\nconstrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the\\narea in which it\\'s false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more\\nfreedom of action in the nodes.  \\n  \\n[28] Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around\\nintermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good\\nidea.  \\n  \\n[29] It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that\\nfrees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some\\nhistorical evidence for it.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n **Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard,\\nPatrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker, Bob\\nMetcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Courtenay Pipkin, Joris\\nPoort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and my younger son for\\nsuggestions and for reading drafts.  \\n  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n* * *  \\n  \\n---\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

      "To do great work, you need to consider three qualities: natural aptitude, deep interest, and the potential to make a significant impact. It is important to find something that you are naturally good at and have a genuine interest in. If you are unsure, it is better to guess and start working on something rather than not doing anything at all. By working on your own projects and following your own curiosity, you can drive your own path towards great work. It is also crucial to continuously learn and expand your knowledge in your chosen field, pushing yourself to the frontiers of knowledge and being curious enough to notice gaps and ask questions that others may overlook.
