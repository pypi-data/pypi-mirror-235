    "The simplest operation that can be accomplished using Oqtant and Oqtant QMS is the creation of quantum matter in the form of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC).  Using Oqtant, users have control of the final cooling step to quantum degeneracy -- the forced radiofrequency evaporation that cools atoms to the ultracold quantum regime.  We saw the most basic form of this control in the previous walkthrough, where we controlled the final state by specifying a target atomic ensemble temperature.\n",

In this walthrough, we will focus mostly on the evaporation phase, leaving exploration of manipulation of the quantum matter for later walkthroughs.  "

    "As seen in walkthrough 1, the simplest way to create a QuantumMatter object is to provide the target temperature as an input parameter, along with an (optional) name.  Additionally, we can control how long the atom ensemble is held after evaporation is complete by passing a *lifetime* parameter, with the units of milliseconds.  Note that this usage of the term *lifetime* is not to be confused with the common usage in physics of an exponentially decaying quantity's $1/e$ time constant, which is also commonly called the lifetime.  In this context, after the hold time (lifetime) is complete, a destructive image will be taken of the ensemble.  In this example, as was the case in walkthrough 1, we will take a \"time of flight\" image (the default) where the ensemble is released from its trap and allowed to freely fall under gravity, expanding according to its effective trap temperature, before the image is taken.  How long the cloud falls before the image is captured is controlled by the *time_of_flight* input parameter, also with the units of milliseconds.  \n",

    "Control of the time of flight is useful for revealing some of the unique features of a BEC.  Specifically, the quantum properties of the atoms in the condensate lead to a distinct expansion as a large, slowly expanding peak that suddenly forms below the transition temperature.  As this peak expands during the time of flight, features of quantum matter such as *shape inversion* can be observed.  Here, an asymmetric atom ensemble, with one or more axes spatially smaller than the other(s), inverts during freefall -- the narrow dimension(s) expand more quickly than the wide dimension, inverting the aspect ratio of the ensemble -- due to (repulsive) internal interaction energy amongst the atoms.  Additionally, the (classical) behavior of the thermal fraction, those atoms that are not condensed, can be studied.  Hotter thermal clouds expand faster and become more diffuse more quickly, while colder clouds expand more slowly.  The details of the cloud shape during the time of flight depend on the initial sample temperature, density, population, and condensed fraction, all of which can be controlled by the user using Oqtant and Oqtant QMS.

When specifying a target temperature, as in our current example, these dynamics are automatically calculated in the backend.

This offset is taken care of in the backend and will still occur even with fully user-defined evaporation curves (see below).  In the plot above, the vertical dashed line indicates the separation of the overall program into the evaporation (t $\\leq$ 0) and manipulation (t $>$ 0) phases.\n",

    "It is important to note that the radiofrequency evaporation frequency is referenced to the energetic trap bottom.  Therefore, the frequency can be interpreted as a *detuning*, where a detuning of zero means we will remove all atoms from the trap.  The closer we get to zero detuning during evaporation, the colder our resulting ensemble will be.  This, of course, comes at the expense of atom population as more atoms need to be removed via evaporation in order to achieve a colder final temperature.  These tradeoffs, and the interplay between evaporation dynamic RF power and frequency and the produced ensemble characteristics, are easily explored using Oqtant."

Our new object is so-called because it can act to throw away any atoms that are heated above a certain temperature, *shielding* the rest of the ensemble from destructive collisions with hot atoms.

This allows for maximum RF power to be delivered at relative high frequencies (detunings) where the evaporation process requires more power, but it also means that the delivered RF power decays as the frequency is lowered towards the energetic trap bottom (0 frequency, in the data structures explored here).  This means that the actual delivered RF power is not, in reality, what is provided in the user-defined *RfEvap* object passed to the program constructor.
