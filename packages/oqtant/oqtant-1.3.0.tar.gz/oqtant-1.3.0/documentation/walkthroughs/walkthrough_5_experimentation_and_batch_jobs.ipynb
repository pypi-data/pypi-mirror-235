Using sequential hardware shots reduces system drift or inconsistency.  In the case of bundling into a single batch job, only one job id will be generated.  Programmatically, the batch job will be composed of multiple *run*s on Oqtant's hardware, and retrieving job results (see below) will require specifying the run number $1 \\ldots N$ when fetching the job results, where there were $N$ runs in the job.    \n",
