    "Welcome to the `Oqtant python API`, aka `OctAPI`, an object-oriented interface for creating, submitting, and retrieving results from experiments with ultracold quantum matter carried out on Infleqtion's Oqtant Quantum Matter Service (QMS) platform.  In this introductory walkthrough, we will explore the basics of how you, the user, interact with Oqtant QMS using Oqtant.  The general workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Oqtant account: [https://oqtant.infleqtion.com](https://oqtant.infleqtion.com)\n",
    "2. Download and install Oqtant (this!): [https://pypi.org/project/oqtant/](https://pypi.org/project/oqtant/)\n",
    "3. Instantiate an instance of the `OqtantClient`, aka the *client*, which facilitates communication with QMS (requires authenticating your account).\n",
    "4. Create a user-defined `QuantumMatter`, aka *matter*, object for making and/or manipulating quantum matter.  This is accomplished with the help of a `QuantumMatterFactory`.  This *factory* will serve as your \"one stop shop\" for creation of abstracted objects that control experiments carried out on the Oqtant hardware.\n",
    "5. Submit your *matter* object to the *client*.  This creates a `OqtantJob`, aka a *job*, that runs on Oqtant's hardware platform(s) and returns a `job id` (UUID or *id*) that can be used for checking job status and retrieving results. \n",
    "6. When your *job* is complete, retrieve and analyze results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, please refer to our documentation: https://gitlab.com/infleqtion/albert/oqtant/-/blob/main/README.md  \n",
    "Also see our companion web application https://oqtant.infleqtion.com/ for quick access to job creation, results, and account management.  \n",
    "Support, feature requests, and bug reports can be submitted here: https://oqtant.infleqtion.com/support\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough focuses on how to use OqtAPI in conjunction with Oqtant QMS.  Follow-on walkthroughs will explore user options, accessible abstractions, and data structures in significantly more detail."
