MewBot is an automation framework intended to simplify building cross-platform text/chat-bots.
The design is intended to be modular with configuration separated from code,
allowing users and developers to build out custom logic and behaviours with
minimal coding experience.

### Status

| WARNING: This project is still in the very early stages.  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

Some basic bots can be built and run, but we currently consider all parts of the framework to be unstable.

### Packages and Modules

The codebase represents both the base API used to build components for the bot,
as well as an implementation of the runtime to actually execute a bot.
As such, it is built and published as a group of packages.

| Package       | Modules         | Description                                                                                                                                |

| `mewbot-test` | `mewbot.tests`  | Utilities for writing tests for MewBot modules.                                                                                            |



![module dependency graph](./mewbot.svg)


These packages are generated by some trickery in [`setup.py`](./setup.py).


Each package also defines its own requirements list. Installing `requirements-dev.txt`
will include all of these automatically.


### Development


Contributions to the project are made via GitHub pull requests, which will
enforce the code style and linting requirements of this project.

#### Setting up project for local development
[//]: # (This section is under development)


The recommended way to set this project up is using python 3.10 (or higher) with
a standard `venv` setup.
The project uses a "src-dir" layout; for Python to be able to locate the modules, 
you will need to set up the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable with at least the `src/` directory.

For convenience in POSIX-like systems, an importable script `./tools/path`
is provided that will return the appropriate path.

The following example will get you started in POSIX-like shells (sh, bash, zsh, etc.).

```shell
# Get the source code
git clone git@github.com:mewler/mewbot
cd mewbot

# Set up the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
printf '. ./tools/path\n' >>venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies (including development dependencies)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run a demo!
python3 -m examples examples/trivial_socket.yaml
```

#### Running the tests and linters

You can run the linters via the convenience script `./tools/lint` or with
`python -m mewbot.tools.lint`
This runs the auto-formatter `black`, two opinionated linting tools in `flake8`
and `pylint`, and the `mypy` type checker in strict mode.

You can run the test framework using the convenience script `./tools/test`
or with `python -m mewbot.tools.test`.
Locally this will default to running all tests in parallel for fast testing.
You can add the flag `--cov` to enable coverage, which will output coverage information
both to the terminal and store details of code coverage as webpages in `coverage/`.

More information on the linters and tests can be found in the
[contributor documentation](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## CREDENTIALS WARNING

Please note.

If you use you credentials for a service with mewbot, you do so at your own risk.
Some services ban accounts if they are used with bots which they determine to be harmful.
This can happen at any time and without warning.

Thus we CANNOT be held responsible if you use your account credentials - whether to generate a bot token or directly - 
with a mewbot bot which subsequently causes your account to be banned.

This is your responsbility. Not ours.
