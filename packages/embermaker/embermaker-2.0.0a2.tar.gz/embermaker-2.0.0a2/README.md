EmberMaker
==========

Purpose
-------
EmberMaker is a scientific graphic library aimed at (re)producing "burning ember" diagrams 
of the style used in IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports.

EmberMaker was formerly a part of the EmberFactory project: https://pypi.org/project/EmberFactory/. 
This is now a separate project, which provides an API for drawing burning ember and related diagrams. 
Starting with version 2.0, the EmberFactory project will thus focus on the web interface and use EmberMaker for 
reading ember data and drawing.

How to use
----------
See /examples. 
The [EmberFactory](https://pypi.org/project/EmberFactory/) is a concrete application .

Development history
-------------------
The EmberFactory software was created by philippe.marbaix -at- uclouvain.be at the end of 2019.
The first objective was to produce figure 3 of Zommers et al. 2020 ([doi.org/10/gg985p](https://doi.org/10/gg985p)).
