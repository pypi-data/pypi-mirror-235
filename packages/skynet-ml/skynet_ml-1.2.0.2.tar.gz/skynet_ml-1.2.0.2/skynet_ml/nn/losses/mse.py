class MeanSquaredError(BaseLoss):
    """
    Implements the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

    MSE is commonly used for regression tasks. It calculates the average of the squared differences 
    between the predicted and actual values.

    Mathematically, for true values y_true and predicted values y_pred, it is defined as:

        MSE = (1/n) * Î£ (y_true - y_pred)^2

    where 'n' is the number of samples.

    Notes:
        - MSE will be high if the predicted values are far from the true values and low if they are close.
        - Its minimum value is 0, which indicates perfect predictions.
