## How to use it? ‚ú®

1. Install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scrape-up --upgrade
```

2. Import the required module and instantiate an object with the necessary parameters:

```python
# Import the required module
from scrape_up import github

# Instantiate an object with the username
user = github.Users(username="nikhil25803")
```

3. Call the desired method to scrape the required information. For example, to extract the number of followers of a user:

```python
# Call the followers method
followers_count = user.followers()

# Print the output
print(followers_count)
```

Output:

```
83
```

## The goal üéØ

In our project journey, we encountered several challenges, including requesting timeouts and rate limits. To overcome these limitations, we developed a powerful Python tool based on web scraping. Our goal is to provide an alternative to APIs for extracting data from various platforms, including GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, and any other website that contains valuable information. Here's what our project aims to achieve:

With our web-scraping-based Python tool, you can unlock a world of data and overcome the limitations often encountered when relying solely on APIs.
