`MontuPython` (transileterated mnṯw ꜥꜣpp(y)) is a Python package intended to compute astronomical ephemerides in the ancient world, thousands of years before present. It was initially designed to compute ephemerides for the ancient Egypt, but it can also be used to study astronomical phenomena in other sites of interest for cultural astronomy (archeoastronomy).

## Download and install

Describe here how the package can be downloaded and install it in
different arquitectures.

If you are using `PyPI` installation it's as simple as:

```
pip install montu
```

You can also test the unstable version of the package with:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ montu
```

## Quick start

In this section you should provide the most simple instructions to use
your package.

For instance:

```
import montu
print(montu.version())
```

## Code examples

For a fully-fledged working example see `examples/montunctions.ipynb`.

In order to properly use MontuPython you need to import the package and load the required
data:

```python
import montu
from montu import *
Montu.load_kernels()
allstars=Stars()
```

It may take a long time to download the planetary kernels, so be patient! 

### Get an historical date in all calendars and scales

One of the most interesting and basic functionalities of MontuPython is to convert date among 
different type of calendars and astronomical scales.  You may taste these functionalities using:

```python
mtime = MonTime('bce2501-01-01 12:00:00')
```

whose output will be:

```
Montu Time Object:
--------------------------
Date in proleptic UTC: -2500-01-01 12:00:00.0000
Date in mixed UTC: -2500-01-22 12:00:00:
Date in SPICE format: 2501 B.C. 01-01 12:00:00.00
General:
    Components: [-1, 2500, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0]
    Is bce: True
    Is Julian: True
Uniform scales:
    Terrestrial time:
        tt: -142006202700.32004
        jtd: 807954.6909685181
    UTC time:
        et: -142006262400.00003
        jed: 807953.9999999997
    Delta-t = TT - UTC = 59699.68000000001
Objects:
    Date in datetime64 format: -2500-01-01T12:00:00.000000
    Date in PyPlanet Epoch: 807953.9999999997
    Date in PyEphem Epoch: -2501/1/22 12:00:00
    Date in AstroPy Time: 807954.6909685181
Astronomical properties at Epoch:
    True obliquity of ecliptic: 23:58:33.587
    True nutation longitude: 00:00:10.214
    Greenwhich Meridian Sidereal Time: 18:40:25.323
```

Notice that the date in Gregorian proleptic will be bce2501-01-01 but in mixed calendar will be bce 2501-01-22.

### Position of mars at an historical date and place

First we need to prepare some basic objects, the Earth (where the observer is), the location on Earth, the time of 
observation and the object to be observed:

```python
earth = PlanetaryBody('Earth')
tebas = ObservingSite(planet=earth,lon=33,lat=24,height=0)
mtime = MonTime('bce2501-01-01 12:00:00')
mars = PlanetaryBody('Mars')
```

Now we can ask for the position of Mars:

```python
mars.calculate_sky_position(mtime,tebas)
```

The result will be:
```
Computing position of body 'mars' at epoch: jtd = 807954.6909685181 
Method 'SPICE':

		Hour angle @ Epoch:  12:20:15.527
		Local coordinates @ Epoch:  06:11:24.275 -41:38:31.094
```

There are different methods to calculate the position of a planets with MontuPython. You can try all of them:

```python
mars.calculate_sky_position(mtime,tebas,method='all')
```

> **NOTE**: Some methods depend on the availability of a network connection.

The result of the previous command will be:
```

### Create a map of the sky

Now we want to create a map of the sky surrounding Aldebaran. For that purpose we get first 
the information about Aldebaran:

```python
aldebaran = allstars.get_stars(ProperName='Aldebaran')
```

Now we select all stars between magnitude -1 and 5 around Aldebaran in a radius of 10 degrees:

```python
hyades = allstars.get_stars_area(RA=aldebaran.data.RA,Dec=aldebaran.data.Dec,radius=10,Mag=[-1,5])
```

Plot the selected stars:

```python
fig,ax = hyades.plot_stars(pad=0.0,labels=False,figargs=dict(figsize=(8,8)))
```

The resulting figure will be:
